            The Civic exemplifies automotive excellence and mixes fun with efficiency and practicality. Precise steering, a solid chassis, and a well-tuned suspension provide both a compliant ride and sweet handling. Sedans and coupes get a 158-hp 2.0-liter four or a 174-hp turbo 1.5-liter four paired with a six-speed manual or a CVT. The turbo is standard on the hatchback; a 180-hp Sport trim is optional and a 10Best winner for 2018. The cabin is spacious, but some may find the seats lack proper support.

                If understated is a style, the Honda New Civic has it in spades. The handsome sedan has aged, but has mostly avoided looking dated.The  exterior hasn’t changed for a few years now, only adding LED headlights and lashings of chrome in a slow, steady march to today’s appearance. It’s handsome and subtle; the most expressive element perhaps is the corporate trapezoidal grille.Inside, the cockpit is busy, but precise. It’s smartly trimmed in a wide number of materials, but subtle hues keep the interior from looking too busy.Compared to the newer Audi A4, the older A6 shows its age. When the A6 is taken alone, it’s perfectly fine.<br>
                 A low, slim dash hides a pop-up screen and we actually prefer it to the newer Audis fitted with a fixed screen. The permanent fixture in newer models has a bolted-on look that we just can’t get behind.

                Honda New Civic is available in both petrol and diesel version. The petrol model carries a 1.5-litre, SOHC, in-line four cylinders i-VTEC engine. The powertrain of the car comes mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 5-speed automatic gearbox, which churns out a maximum power output of 117bhp. While for the first time Honda has brought City in diesel model which in houses a 1.5 litre i-DTEC engine that produces a power output of 98.6bhp. What makes the City so good for city driving is continuous torque even on lower RPMs. You just don't need to change gears frequently. The midranges are also strong but here you miss that punch and the third gear is a bit hard and where you need to change gears a little early. After this, the fourth and fifth gears are smooth and the car goes quite well till the 6000rpm. The car reaches 150kmph mark with ease and the highest speed in terms of diesel variant is 190kmph, while, with petrol fuel trim, it achieves a speed of  165kmph. The good thing about Honda City is that it stays stable even on high speeds. Both the automatic and manual transmissions are smooth and there is a little to no gear lag. The top-end variant City VX CVT comes with paddle shift which is something you can find only in a limited number of cars. Paddle shift allows you to shift gears manually even in an automatic transmission car on a single touch. In a nutshell, Honda City is a good urban drive, which comes with a blend of performance and luxury. Check out the following video.

                Honda New Civic isn’t just a Brio with a boot, but a fresh, all-new compact sedan. The second-generation Amaze is built on an all-new platform, which will be a base for future models. It has grown – the Amaze is longer, wider and taller than the outgoing car, while the wheelbase is a significant 65mm longer than before. Overall, the design of the new Amaze is quite striking and nothing like the previous car’s. The buff and vertical nose looks quite unconventional and could split opinion, but what works to make the Amaze look wider than it is, is the thick, signature chrome grille bar and the stretched, flat bonnet. The sides are a lot cleaner and get a single character line which looks neat but not quite as distinctive as the prominent two slashes across the earlier Amaze’s flanks.

                <p>In terms of specifications, the new Civic will offer a petrol as well as a Diesel engine. The petrol engine on offer is likely to be a 1.8-litre unit that will come mated to a 6-speed manual transmission as standard. It will also offer an optional CVT automatic. The Diesel engine on offer will come mated to a 6-speed manual transmission only. The new Civic looks really modern and should impress with its design and styling. Both the exterior and the interior of this car look very flamboyant. We are pretty sure that the new model’s design will find a wide acceptance amongst many age groups.

                    This is not the first-ever Civic for India. We earlier had the 8th generation model on sale here. The earlier Civic turned out to be very profitable for the company, at least in its initial days. It came with a design that made every other car look too old. It also offered an excellent 1.8-litre petrol engine. The interior of the old Civic looks so modern that it can hold its own even in this day and age. However, the lack of a Diesel engine option cost the car dearly. While petrol cars are fast regaining popularity, there is still a major chunk of car buyers that prefer buying a Diesel car. This time around, Honda has all the bases covered as it will launch the new model in both petrol and Diesel guises.
