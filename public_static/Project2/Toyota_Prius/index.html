                    <p><b>The 2018 Toyota Prius wins our minds with its fuel-efficiency and low running costs. Our hearts are a different story.</b></p><br>
                    The 2018 Toyota Prius quietly marches on this year—literally and figuratively.
                    Not much has changed from last year, beyond a larger touchscreen in top-tier models and Prius Prime plug-in versions. The 2018 Prius is two years removed from a total overhaul and hitting its (fuel-efficient) stride.
                    The Prius Prime looks better to our eyes, if only because it smooths over the stilted edges from the Prius Plain. There are many angles and shapes in the Prius’s face, flanks, and fanny. It’s a jumble of lines wrapped around the iconic liftback shape that the Prius has largely cornered.
                    The fourth generation Toyota Prius Hybrid has been launched in the country priced at Rs 38.96 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) for the single Z8 variant. The new generation model was launched internationally last year and was also showcased by the Japanese carmaker at the 2016 Auto Expo in India.

                            The 2018 Toyota Prius skips our trends in hopes that taste will come around again in the way, say, leg warmers and cut-off tees won’t get us kicked out of our favorite restaurant.
                            The newest generation has a lower and sleeker nose than before, which gives it a sharper entry than the rounded shapes from yesteryear.
                            <br>Along the sides, the Prius uses several tricks and slashes to break up the slab-sided looks from outgoing cars. The rear roof pillar is black, which give the Prius a “floating roofline” but the shape starts to fall apart at the rear. The rear end is high, as before, with chevron-shaped taillight lenses at the top outer corners of the tail.]But those taillights have tails of their own, making them almost into question marks that point down toward the ground, drawing attention to the height of the tail, despite a blacked-out lower section of the rear bumper cover.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Toyota Prius doesn’t prioritize performance.</p></b>
                            The new Prius is lower, longer, and wider than the old model, which boosts outward vision and to lower the center of gravity for a sharper ride.
                            The Prius is still powered by a 1.8-liter inline-4 that makes 95 horsepower and 53-kw electric motor for a combined output of 121 hp. That’s paired to a continuously variable transmission that prioritizes efficiency above fun, which makes sense given the application.
                            The Prius is built on Toyota’s newest platform and benefits from a more rigid frame. It lacks the floppiness from previous iterations, but its steering feel is largely devoid of any interest for the driver.
                            For the first time, two different battery packs are offered in the Prius. The Prius Two Eco uses a 1.2-kwh nickel-metal-hydride pack that has been used in multiple generations of the Prius. Every other Prius uses a 0.75-kwh lithium-ion pack that features a lighter, more compact unit that effectively uses more of its charge.

                            The 2018 Toyota Prius is a marked improvement in overall comfort from previous generations—especially its front seats.
                            The newest Prius is more comfortable than previous iterations. The front seats have better bolstering and deeper bottoms than the last generation’s pews. It’s a better view too. The Prius ditches the last-generation’s outdated information screens in favor of high-definition color displays that we’d expect from a car built in this decade.
                            The backseat in the Prius officially seats three (just two in the Prius Prime), which is possible, but two adults will be more comfortable on long trips. The 33.4 inches of rear leg room on paper is believable, but it’s head space that may kink taller riders more. The sloped roofline cuts into head space, so 6-footers will need short torsos to fit comfortably for long.

                        The IIHS calls the Prius a Top Safety Pick, with “Good” scores on all available crash tests, and an “Acceptable” rating for its LED headlights. Federal testers largely agree and gave the Prius a top five-star rating, but noted four stars for frontal crash safety.
                        <br>All trim levels get Toyota Safety Sense-P, which includes forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, automatic high beams, and adaptive cruise control. The IIHS rates the system as “Superior” in avoiding low- (12 mph) and high-speed (25 mph) crashes.
                        Blind-spot monitors, a head-up display, and parking sensors are reserved for top models.Outward vision in the Prius isn’t ideal—the rear window is still split and the rear roof pillar is extra chunky, good for peanut butter but bad for blind spots.

                            Prius One manages to be well-equipped starting at $24,370 with LED headlights and taillights, a 4.2-inch driver information display, cloth upholstery, 15-inch wheels, a standard suite of advanced safety equipment (that we cover separately), keyless ignition, a rearview camera, and a 6.1-inch touchscreen. The Prius One is geared toward fleet buyers, but may be a savvy pick for tight budgets. 
                            Toyota’s larger 11.6-inch touchscreen is standard on Prius Four and Prius Four Touring trim levels. Those versions add heated front seats and a power-adjustable driver’s seat. Power passenger seats, blue contrast stitching, and automatic wipers are offered on the Prius Four Touring trim.
                            Prius Prime models generally follow the same convention with Plus, Premium, and Advanced trim levels receiving Prius Two, Prius Three Touring, and Prius Four Touring equipment, respectively.

                            The most common version on the roads will manage 54 mpg city, 50 highway, 52 combined, according to the EPA. That’s the least-efficient version, mind you, and it’s still good enough for a near-perfect score on our scale.
                            Opt for a Prius Eco, which cuts weight from the other trim levels, and those numbers improve to 58/53/56 mpg, according to the EPA.Looking for that black belt in fuel efficiency? That’d be the Prius Prime, which packs more batteries than the Prius and adds a plug for electron-only operation. It’s rated by the EPA at 55/53/54 mpg, but up to 25 miles of electric-only drive on a full charge on up to 640 miles with both tanks topped up.
