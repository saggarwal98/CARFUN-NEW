Made with the “Active-Solid Motion” exterior design philosophy for toughness and active movement, the BR-V is equipped with a tough hood, a solid motion pillar, high ground clearance and a strong fender.</p>

                <p><b>The 2018 Honda BR-V spaces out when it comes to economy-car goodness.</b></p><br>
                Honda has launched BR-V Style Edition in India ahead of the 2018 festive season. The Style Edition includes some exterior accessories that are available at no extra cost over standard BR-V. The Style Edition is available on all variants of the petrol and diesel BR-V, apart from E MT, which is the base variant with petrol-manual powertrain.
                The BR-V is available with Honda’s existing 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines which produce 119PS/145Nm and 100PS/200Nm respectively. Both the engines are mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. However, the petrol engine gets a CVT option as well.
                The Honda BR-V is offered in a total of eight variants, four each for petrol and diesel. Prices for this crossover start from Rs 9.22 lakh and go up to Rs 13.39 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

                        <b><p>The Honda BR-V doesn’t get many second looks.</p></b>
                        The mini-minivan silhouette of the BR-V bears some details that cut the shape down to size. There’s a deep crease stamped low on its sides, which makes it appear longer than it really is. The windshield has a steep rake, and the hood is short and stubby, but the BR-V still looks good on its 15-inch base or 16-inch upgrade wheels. Big taillights run down from the top of its hatch into the bumpers in a way that Volvo wouldn’t find unfamiliar. If it were our call, we’d paint in body color the matte-chrome bar incised across the BR-V’s rear.
                        The relative restraint that Honda's designers kept to for its exterior was mostly thrown away inside, where things are a little too ambitious. An ultra-busy instrument panel is loaded with shapes, pieces, trims, bezels, and surfaces that can feel a little haphazard. While nothing looks and feels especially low-rent, the BR-V pales in comparison to the simpler look offered by the Honda HR-V, a small crossover derived from the BR-V.

                        The BR-V is available with Honda’s existing 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines which produce 119PS/145Nm and 100PS/200Nm respectively. Both the engines are mated to a 6-speed manual transmission. However, the petrol engine gets a CVT option as well.
                        Like the 1.5 i-VTEC engine which is the best 1.5 petrol in the country. Period. Mated to a CVT, performance is a bit blunted, but once you get used to the convenience of the automatic, you won’t complain. In fact, my daily office run of 8km and 11 traffic lights has convinced me that nothing beats a CVT for responsiveness and smoothness. The transmission is alert and jerk-free, which is perfect for stop-start traffic. The driving position is spot on (like on most Hondas) with good all-round visibility, so you always feel in control.

                        BR-V has a lot of space, especially for knee and head room. And, of course, it is the only car in its class with three rows of seating. The seats all round aren’t just well-cushioned and supportive, these recline as well. And the second row can slide fore and aft giving more flexibility to occupants to be able to utilise the space in the best way possible. Furthermore, it is easy to access the third row too. The middle seat with 60:40 split function tumbles down quickly creating easy access. And once in the third row, it feels decently airy too.
                        The steering is light and responsive and it also weighs up nicely at speeds. The ride is sorted too. It is firm but is absorbent at speed and doesn’t thud too much over poor roads either. And it manages unseen speed bumps and undulations well too.

                        The Honda BR-V is equipped with keyless entry, push-button start, automatic climate control and an integrated music system with steering-mounted controls. On the safety front, it gets dual airbags, ABS, EBD, rear parking sensor with a camera and an electronic engine immobiliser.
                        The interior is similar to the refreshed Amaze and has some bits from the BR-V and the City. And, that only makes it good, as the all-black theme is inviting. But look closer and the quality of plastic and fit and isn’t class leading. In fact, it is a step down compared to the Creta. It isn’t as well equipped either. So, there’s no touch-screen or reversing camera.
                        It does however get automatic climate control, a three-pod instrument cluster with a built-in trim computer, leather, height-adjustable driver’s seat and aircon vents for second row of passengers.

                        The company claims a mileage of 15.4 kmpl for the petrol and 21.9kmpl for the diesel. On the other hand, the CVT variant of the petrol-powered BR-V returns a mileage of 16kmpl.
                        With ARAI claimed fuel efficiencies of 15.4kmpl for the petrol and 21.9kmpl for the diesel, the car boasts of the best-in-segment fuel economy. Pretty impressive on paper. The figures in real world conditions will be clear when we do a thorough road test soon. First impressions suggest- it won’t be a tough task.
