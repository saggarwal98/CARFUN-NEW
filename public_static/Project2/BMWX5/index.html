        <p style="margin-left:280px;margin-right:260px;">With its dynamic, upright proportions, the third-generation BMW X5 is instantly recognisable as a BMW X model. However, it also has several new design features which further emphasise its majestic appearance and unbeatable versatility. One important element of the optimised design is the focus on aerodynamics.</p>

                    <p><b>The 2018 BMW X5 remains a thoughtful crossover SUV for families, although enthusiasts may be left wanting unless the right options are selected.</b></p>
                    The 2018 BMW X5 is a luxury mid-size crossover that started the craze. It's handsomely equipped and reasonably capable with that all-important roundel planted in its snout.
                    The X5 changes little for 2018, other than a sport-tuned version of its automatic transmission is now standard on almost all versions, and the German automaker has shuffled option packages to act more like trim levels.There’s less configurability, but little lacking in this lineup.
                    The BMW X5 currently is positioned as the largest SUV in the BMW lineup and is priced from Rs 74.7 lakh to Rs 80.1 lakh, ex-showroom pan-India. The X5 is being offered in two variants - the xDrive20d Expedition and the xDrive20d M Sport. The BMW X5 in India is offered with a single diesel engine option.

                            <b><p>Although a little dowdy outside, the BMW X5 is very attractive inside.</p></b>
                            With its evolutionary looks, the 2018 BMW X5 isn’t a head-turner, but its warmly attractive interior more than makes up for that.
                            The X5’s exterior is the definition of a BMW crossover, a look that the automaker has perfected over the last decade. If you’ve been to an upscale shopping mall, you’ve seen some variation on the theme. The automaker’s twin kidney grille is displayed prominently up front with some subtle creasing along the sides that adds a hint of definition. At the rear, its tail lights arc gently upward. The X5’s tailgate is a two-piece design—a boon for hanging out before a baseball game, but a slight hindrance for loading bigger items.
                            Inside, that corporate conservative look carries over, but to better effect. All models boast meaty three-spoke steering wheels and a choice between several wood and aluminum options. Controls are arrayed in a simple fashion, with most grouped together within easy reach of the driver.

                            There’s a lot to choose from under the 2018 BMW X5’s hood.
                            The hybrid X5 xDrive40e is more of a head-scratcher. A 2.0-liter turbo-4 gas engine mates to an 8-speed automatic and is supplemented by a 9.2-kwh lithium-ion battery pack. Combined, BMW quotes 308 hp and 332 lb-ft. Charged up, the xDrive40e can go 14 miles solely on electricity before the gas engine kicks on. The hybrid system behaves differently depending on the selected setting. Pick MAX eDrive and you’ll use no gasoline unless you floor the accelerator, but it limits the top speed to 75 mph. Leave it in automatic mode and the gas engine will mostly stay off below 45 mph. That sounds nice, but the $4,000 premium will take a long time to recoup unless your daily commute can be done only on electricity.

                            <b><p>Great room for five, good cargo capacity, and a well-wrought interior are all assets for the BMW X5.</p></b>
                            The 2018 BMW X5 lineup spans a wide range, but all versions feel appropriately high-class for their price, offer good room for five, and plenty of cargo space.
                            At the base end, the X5 is upholstered in synthetic leather that’s reasonably convincing, but real hides in several grades of quality are optional in a wide range of hues. Glossy wood trim is standard, with several variations on the options list to allow buyers to tailor their X5 to their tastes. The X5’s standard front seats are supportive and power-adjustable; optional sports seats on some trim configurations can feel a little more confining for wider drivers. Our favorite thrones are the extra-cost multi-contour variants, which are beautifully finished and adjustable in every conceivable direction short of ejector seat mode.

                            A wide array of safety tech is available on the 2018 BMW X5, but you’ll pay quite a bit for the most advanced tech. The X5 has all the right ingredients to score high on our scale, but incomplete testing results from the IIHS mean we can’t assign it a final value.
                            <br>All X5s now come with a standard rearview camera, something that previously required paying extra—a surprise given their hefty prices. A head-up display is optional, as are features like automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, a surround-view camera system, and active lane control.
                            <br>Add BMW’s Parking Assistant and, at the press of a button, the X5 will slide itself into most parallel or perpendicular parking situations. An optional Traffic Jam Assistant provides a small degree of autonomy in high traffic situations by keeping the X5 within its lane and a set distance from the vehicle in front.

                            Even with some streamlining of the 2018 BMW X5’s ordering sheet this year, you’ll still want to spend some time working your way through its optional equipment to ensure you’re getting exactly what you—and your budget—may want.
                            At the base end for gas and turbodiesel 6-cylinder models, you’ll find reasonably convincing synthetic leather upholstery, 14-way power-adjustable and heated front seats, adaptive xenon headlights, nine-speaker audio, a power tailgate, and a power panoramic moonroof.
                            <br>The V-8-powered X5 xDrive50i runs a hefty $74,795, but in addition to its engine, it includes leather upholstery, 20-way power seats, keyless ignition, Harman Kardon audio, and a few other goodies. The X5 M builds on that with its own suspension, more power, and bigger brakes, plus a styling kit similar to the optional M Sport package.

                            To simplify, we’ve based our score on the one you’re statistically most likely to take home, the xDrive35i. It’s rated using the EPA test at 18 mpg city, 24 highway, 20 combined.
                            The hybrid xDrive40e is rated at 24 mpg combined, but 56 MPGe based on how much energy is required to produce the electricity that gives it a 14 mile electric-only range. As with any plug-in hybrid, your mileage may (and will) vary. With a short commute, you may almost never use gasoline. On a highway trip, the xDrive40e may be just as thirsty as the non-hybrid xDrive35i.
