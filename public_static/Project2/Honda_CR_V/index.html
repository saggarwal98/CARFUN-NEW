                    <p><b>The 2018 Honda CR-V may be light on personality, but this compact crossover checks off every other box. It’s a very smart choice.</b></p><br>
                    For most drivers, the CR-V blends a tall-riding drive with usable interior space, just enough power, and a fuel-efficient powertrain.
                    Most CR-Vs—EX and above—feature a strong 1.5-liter turbo-4 that cranks out 190 horsepower and 179 pound-feet of torque. A continuously variable transmission is the only gearbox on offer. It’s not a powertrain setup that will stoke enthusiasts’ flames, but the CR-V’s turbo engine provides smooth acceleration even with a full load of passengers and suitcases aboard.
                    CR-V LX trim levels use a 2.4-liter inline-4 rated at 184 hp and 180 lb-ft of torque, but the base engine is a little gruff, its power delivery is peaky and requires a good stab at the throttle, and it isn’t as fuel efficient.
                    The Honda CR-V 2.0L 2WD MT is now priced at Rs 21.53 lakh, as opposed to Rs 22.64 lakh pre-GST. This is a drop of approx Rs 1.11 lakh.

                            <b><p>We’re impressed with the 2018 Honda CR-V’s clean, organized interior, but its exterior is a little too quirky.</p></b>
                            All CR-V trim levels look about the same outside, aside from the upsized alloy wheels that come on EX and higher trim levels. Up front, the CR-V’s bumper juts out like an underbite not yet tamed by an orthodontist. The grille above is split between chrome and black plastic, with the former flanked by wrap-around headlights. The CR-V’s side profile is more cohesive and we like the way the beltline sweeps upward to create a little more visual heft. At the rear, the high-mounted taillights continue a Honda tradition and aid safety. A chrome eyebrow runs between the two sides for a more upscale feel, but the overall look is more pint-size minivan than rugged four-wheeler.
                            The CR-V’s interior is what scores this crossover a point above average. Honda mounted all controls up high, including the stubby gear lever.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Honda CR-V has a good ride and a willing turbo-4 engine option.</p></b>
                            The entry-level CR-V LX is the only model in the lineup with a 2.4-liter inline-4 rated at 184 horsepower and 180 pound-feet of torque. It’s mated exclusively to a continuously variable transmission (CVT) and is offered with both front- and all-wheel drive. The base inline-4 is strong enough, but power comes on only at higher engine speeds. Translation: You’ll need to dig deep into the throttle to motivate the CR-V for much more than stoplight-to-stoplight driving. It’s a little grumbly compared to the 1.5-liter turbo-4 standard elsewhere in the CR-V lineup.
                            That pint-size turbo engine is rated at 190 hp and 179 lb-ft of torque. It’s not much faster than the base CR-V, but power is ample just off of idle, which makes the 1.5-liter much more usable in any kind of driving. Moreover, the turbo-4 is much smoother and seems to work better with the CVT.

                            The 2018 Honda CR-V serves as a reminder that its maker is a master of interior packaging. It may be a compact crossover on paper, but the CR-V feels more like a mid-sizer from inside. We’ve given it points above average for its good front and rear seats and for its numerous cargo storage options ready to tuck away everything from juice boxes to mountain bikes.
                            CR-V EX and higher trim levels include a 12-way power driver’s seat that offers lots of adjustment and long-distance comfort. The standard fabric upholstery feels classy, while the optional leather is surprisingly dressy for this price point. CR-Vs we’ve driven have had a tight, well-assembled feel and interior materials are generally above average for the price point.

                        <b><p>The 2018 Honda CR-V offers lots of advanced safety tech and has done well in crash-testing.</p></b>
                        All 2018 CR-Vs include six airbags, stability control, and anti-lock brakes. EX, EX-L, and Touring trim levels come with the automaker’s Honda Sensing suite of safety equipment: automatic emergency braking, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, and a road departure mitigation system that nudges the CR-V back onto the tarmac if its driver begins to drift. None of the Honda Sensing equipment is available on the CR-V LX, unfortunately.
                        The IIHS says that CR-Vs equipped with LED headlights and Honda Sensing are Top Safety Pick award-winners. Unfortunately, those headlights, rated “Acceptable” by the IIHS, are only on Touring trims. The halogen units on LX, EX, and EX-L are rated “Marginal.” However, all versions of the CR-V performed well in the agency’s battery of crash tests and the crossover’s automatic emergency braking equipment is highly rated.

                            <b><p>The sweet spot here is the well-equipped 2018 Honda CR-V EX; add leather if you want.</p></b>
                            The Honda CR-V LX serves as the entry to the lineup and it’s outfitted with 17-inch alloy wheels, automatic climate control, cruise control, Bluetooth, a rearview camera, and a fairly basic four-speaker audio system. The LX is the only CR-V to come with the 2.4-liter inline-4, while other variants include a turbocharged 1.5-liter inline-4.
                            The CR-V EX includes heated front seats, a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, keyless ignition, a 12-way power driver’s seat, a power moonroof, an extra USB input, and the automaker’s full suite of collision-avoidance tech (which it brands Honda Sensing). At around $2,500, that’s a heck of a lot of stuff.
                            Topping the line is the CR-V Touring, which builds on the EX-L trim with unique wheels, automatic windshield wipers, a hands-free tailgate, and an uprated audio system with a subwoofer.

                            Best case, the front-wheel-drive CR-V with the 1.5-liter engine is rated at 28 mpg city, 34 highway, 30 combined. All-wheel drive drops those figures to 27/33/29 mpg, which is still pretty good. <br>
                            Only the CR-V LX includes the 2.4-liter inline-4, which isn’t as thrifty as the engine standard otherwise. Stick with front-wheel drive, and the CR-V LX is rated at 26/32/28 mpg; the all-wheel drive version comes in at a still-decent 25/31/27 mpg.
                            All versions of the CR-V run on regular unleaded gasoline.The base inline-4 is strong enough, but power comes on only at higher engine speeds.
