                    <p><b>The 2018 BMW 7-Series is a plush ride with plenty of powertrain options and customizable features that places it among the full-size greats.</b></p>
                    The 2018 BMW 7-Series full-size luxury sedan is excellence hiding in plain sight. The 7-Series features the automaker’s most advanced construction, its most powerful or most efficient engine, and the latest technology.For 2018, the 7-Series largely stands pat. Semi-autonomous driving features are now available on base models and advanced parking features such as a surround-view camera system are available on more models.
                    The 2018 BMW 740i will be the first stop for many buyers, but a plug-in hybrid 740e xDrive isn’t far off in price after applicable federal incentives. At the other end of the spectrum, a V-12-powered M760i xDrive sedan starts at more than $157,000 and ends its 60 mph sprint in 3.6 seconds.

                            <b><p>The 2018 BMW 7-Series’ looks can range from nerdy to butch, but all trims are closer to elegant than most anything else on the road.</p></b>
                            From the outside, the BMW 7-Series builds on the sedan’s rear-drive proportions with a long hood that’s punctuated by creases that run from nose to cabin. Along the sides, a belt line rises from the front fender and elegantly wraps around the rear and its taillights. Predictably, the V-12-powered M760i has flourishes of masculinity (if there’s such a thing) with butch tailpipes and a muscular lower front bumper. BMW’s corporate twin-kidney grille on the 7-Series is larger and taller than other models that wear the new nose, particularly the new 5-Series.
                            <br>The 7-Series also shares its interior style with the 5-Series, albeit not as flashy. Whereas the mid-size sedan can wear higher-contrast combinations, the 7-Series is a mostly subdued affair with richer shades and a tonier feel to the interior trim materials.

                            <b><p>The 2018 BMW 7-Series impersonates a performance car with an available V-12, but we know better: it’s a handsome and comfortable cruiser.</p></b>
                            The 2018 BMW 7-Series is motivated by a broad spectrum of powertrains, perhaps one of the largest spreads for any sedan on sale.Its most efficient version is powered by a turbo-4 and a battery pack, its most powerful version is powered by a turbo-12 and your courage.
                            <br>Most versions will be powered by a turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-6 under the hoods of 740i models. That engine makes 320 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque and can power the rear or all four wheels when equipped with all-wheel drive, which is optional.
                            The 740e pairs a turbo-4 and a 9.2-kwh battery for a total system output of 322 hp. It’s the most efficient way to drive a 7-Series and also the most relaxed. Even though V-8s are a traditional pick for full-size buyers, this one feels like an outlier. It’s understandably not as efficient as the hybrid, nor is it strictly necessary; the turbo-6 is just fine.The trade-off is a 23-mile all-electric range in the 740e.

                            The front seats are nothing to sneeze at. Even base seats are all-day comfortable and shod with soft nappa hides. The big, supportive thrones can be tailor-made for your tush with customizable shades—for enough money, of course.
                            <br>Rear-seat riders have plenty to brag about. The rear seats have 44.4 inches of leg room, made longer by a rear seat executive option that adds 3.5 inches, a foot rest for the right rear seat, fold-out tables, and twin 10-inch entertainment screens. Paired with another optional Luxury Rear Seat Package, the heated and cooled seats can soothe aching boardroom muscles with an in-seat massager, and a 7.0-inch popout tablet can control entertainment functions such as radio, media, climate, and navigation. The tablet can also instantly Google rising commodity prices, via the 7-Series built-in wifi hotspot, if your name happens to be Randolph or Mortimer Duke.

                            The 2017 BMW 7-Series hasn't been tested under either of the U.S. crash-test programs. And seeing that this model typically has a very low sales volume and both the NHTSA and IIHS try to test vehicles based on popularity, it's likely to stay that way.
                            That said, the 7-Series builds on quite the reputation for occupant safety, and it includes a great set of standard safety features. The standard kit includes front side airbags, rear-seat side airbags, knee airbags, and front-seat active head restraints. New Adaptive Headlamps are also standard.
                            Buyers can choose from quite the list of safety options. A second-generation Night Vision 2 system adds pedestrian detection. A Driver Assistance Package includes blind-spot detection and a lane-departure warning system, which vibrates the steering wheel when the car drifts from from the marked lane.

                            The 7-Series nearly aces our features scale for good reason: it’s plentiful in base equipment, opulent and infinitely customizable from there, and it has a good infotainment system. To go any further would require something that makes the 7-Series stand out among competitors.
                            <br>Most people may consider the 2.2-inch touchscreen keyfob as a big deal, but we say it’s just big. The fob can air condition the car before you’ve set foot in it, navigate the 7-Series into tight parking spaces, or even tell you the status of your car—all things that might also be done on a smartphone that’s already in your pocket.
                            Base 740i models are equipped with leather seats, 18-inch wheels, wood trim, adjustable air suspension, LED headlights, power adjustable front seats, a Harman Kardon sound system with 16 speakers, 12.3 inch driver information display, 10.2-inch touchscreen, dual-panel sunroof, and power everything—including trunk lid.

                            BMW offers the 7-Series in a wide array of engine sizes, ranging from a plug-in hybrid inline-4 to a twin-turbocharged V-12. <br>
                            Most examples will be 740i models, which are powered by an inline-6 that the EPA rates at 20 mpg city, 29 highway, 23 combined with all-wheel drive.Those numbers go up or down from there. Opting for the V-8 found in the 750i drops those numbers significantly to 16/25/19 mpg. Opting for rear-wheel drive in the 740i or 750i adds 1 mpg across the board, give or take.
                            The plug-in hybrid 740e is rated for all-electric travel of up to 23 miles (up to 75 mph), or is rated at 27 mpg combined.The V-12-powered M760i will manage 13/20/16 mpg according to the EPA.
