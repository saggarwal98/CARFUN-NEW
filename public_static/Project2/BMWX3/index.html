                    <p><b>The 2018 BMW X3 ventures into M territory, but doesn’t lose sight of its SUV duties.</b></p>
                    With the new X3, BMW doesn't shake the earth with radical design changes or size gains. The philosophy telegraphs itself: don't break it, just burnish it. The X3 has taller glass and bigger intakes, but the shape’s a clear and gradual progression of the X3, nothing radical. Inside, BMW has moved the ball too, with a cockpit that’s grown warmer and more infotainment-friendly. The X3's iDrive control puck rides shotgun to its space-age shifter joystick, and the dash wears interesting brackets of metallic or wood trim.
                    Performance issues from a 248-horsepower 2.0-liter turbo-4 in base models. All-wheel drive is standard, as is an 8-speed automatic. Base models don't want for power, a week behind the wheel of an xDrive30i was proof enough.

                            <b><p>The latest BMW X3 has a taller stance, but the wagon-like SUV recipe hasn’t been altered too much.</p></b>
                            The 2018 BMW X3 modulates its sheet metal in the usual ways in its third generation. The cabin benefits more from the gradual changes, as it becomes a cleaner, clearer place to work.
                            With the new X3, BMW doesn't shake the earth with radical design changes or size gains.
                            On its third trip through BMW's redesign studios, the X3 adopts the same philosophy of the current X5: don't break it, just burnish it. The X3 has some wider air intakes, and the crossover SUV sits somewhat lower and wider on its wheels than in the last generation. From the side, it has very tall glass areas, which gives it a slightly bulbous look but pays dividends in outward vision.
                            The front wheels have been moved forward, further away from the dash, for better proportions, and the rear end's been scaled up visually with more glass and larger taillights.

                            <b><p>The 2018 BMW X3 elicits some carlike road manners from its tall-wagon body, especially with the first M-badged model.</p></b>
                            BMW has instilled more of the performance of its 3-Series sedans and wagons in the distantly related X3 SUV. In M40i trim, it’s a near faultless machine with great grip and poise.  
                            <br>BMW fits its workhorse 2.0-liter turbo-4 to the X3 xDrive30i. With 248 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque, the standard-issue version can drop 0-60 mph runs in less than six seconds and reach 130 mph, even with the extra weight of standard all-wheel drive. An 8-speed automatic is the sole transmission offered on this model.
                            <br>Like other BMW cars with the same engine, the turbo-4 in the xDrive30i is smooth and responsive, it blends seamlessly into the car's behavior. Its pickup is geared toward the lower rev range, its pep is best in stop-and-go grands prix duty. On the interstate, the 8-speed kicks down quickly enough to find a sweet spot for the engine, but there's still a hint of lag. On affordability alone, the xDrive30i is the smart choice between the two engines, but even those buyers can be confident that they're not sacrificing much.

                            <b><p>The 2018 X3’s interior shows lots of thought, with right-sized human space and lots of small-item storage.</p></b>
                            By the numbers, the 2018 X3 measures 112.8 inches between the wheels. It’s 186.1 inches long in M40i trim, and 74.7 inches wide. It’s gained a couple of inches in wheelbase, but net interior space isn’t much larger in any dimension.
                            <br>Heated and cooled seats are an option, but standard is the spread-out space in every direction. The X3’s particularly abundant in head room: with the available panoramic sunroof, 6-foot-tall passengers will have no room to complain, what with a few inches of space left between their scalps and the headliner.
                            BMW promises 40.3 inches of front seat leg room, and 36.4 inches in back, and the X3 lives up to the numeric billing. In back, passengers can slide in easily thanks to the X3’s wide door cuts. The back seat looks flat but has enough support for long trips. Knee room allows 6-foot passengers to sit behind a 6-foot driver, no problem.

                            The X3 comes with the usual airbags and stability control on every model. For 2018, on the models announced so far, all-wheel drive also is standard, as are Bluetooth and a rearview camera. <br>
                            Two packages add more safety technology to either X3. One for $900 adds lane-departure warnings and blind-spot monitors, as well as forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking. It’s a bit galling that on a luxury vehicle priced at nearly $44,000 base these features aren’t standard. The Honda Fit makes those active safety features standard at less than half the price to start.
                            <br>For $1,700, BMW fits adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go functionality, active lane control, and traffic-jam assist for Level 2 autonomous driving ability. With the latter, the car takes over steering, braking, and acceleration for nearly a minute before it commands drivers to retake the wheel.

                            The latest BMW X3 has the options and standard equipment we expect, and good resident infotainment.
                            It’s lighter on some of the custom touches found in high-end BMWs, and its warranty is just average. 
                            <br>The $43,445 X3 xDrive30i comes with the usual power features, 18-inch wheels with all-season run-flat tires, automatic climate control, AM/FM/CD audio, Bluetooth, a power tailgate, a rearview camera, power front seats, and reclining rear seats.
                            <br>The X3 finally has a 10.3-inch touchscreen for its iDrive system. It’s a beautiful high-resolution display and also can be fitted with the gesture controls found on the 7-Series. But the touchscreen only comes on X3s with navigation. Otherwise, the iDrive system and rearview camera display on a 6.5-inch screen.

                            BMW no longer offers a turbodiesel in the X3, but plug-in hybrid and battery-electric models are in the the offing.
                            All the X3 models announced so far in the 2018 model year come with standard all-wheel drive. Coupled with the base turbocharged inline-4 engine and an 8-speed automatic, the X3 xDrive30i earns EPA ratings of 22 mpg city, 29 highway, 25 combined. Those numbers are 1, 2, and 1 mpg higher than last year’s base model.
                            The twin-turbocharged inline-6 in the X3 M40i has a surprise in its EPA numbers. They’re 20/27/23 mpg, just 1 mpg lower each than last year’s base model. If fuel economy is your chief concern, there’s not much angst involved in going all-out on power.
