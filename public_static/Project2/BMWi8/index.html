                    <p><b>The 2015 BMW i8 is a ground-breaking new sports coupe with a plug-in hybrid powertrain that delivers several driving personalities from which the driver can choose.</b></p><br>
                    The BMW i8 is the second, the most alluring, and the priciest model from BMW's revolutionary "i" sub-brand. The goal of the "i" cars is nothing less to reinvent the automobile for a new and more energy-efficient world. That label first spawned the boxy i3 electric car, but whereas that hatchback is all about elegantly soothing and miminal city transport, the i8 is meant to respond to the need for "a new era of sustainable performance," according to BMW. Like that of the i3, the i8's body shell is made of carbon-fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP), carried on an aluminum chassis that absorbs frontal crash energy and holds the powertrain.
                    The electric motor up front is rated at 96 kilowatts (131 horsepower) and 184 lb-ft of torque; it's used for all-electric running at speeds up to 75 mph.

                            <b><p>The classic sports coupe shape of the 2015 BMW i8 is drop-dead gorgeous; it attracts crowds, photos, and awe.</p></b>
                            Any low, sleek, fast sports car attracts attention, but the 2015 BMW i8 seems to take that rule to a new level, even by the jaded standards of Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles. Perhaps it's the classic coupe shape--a low, fastback profile--amplified by the swing-up doors, which are hinged from the windshield pillar and known in German as flugeltur, or "wing doors." And indeed, with its doors, hood, and rear decklid open, the i8 even takes on a vaguely raptor shape, as if it's about to swoop down and pounce.
                            The i8 is wrapped tightly around its 20-inch wheels, and the body sculpting successfully emphasize the horizontal lines of the car--despite a relatively tall tail with a slab-sided panel aft of the rear wheel arch. It's all in the service of reducing aerodynamic drag, which consumes more energy at speeds greater than 30 mph than does moving the car itself. BMW quotes a drag coefficient of 0.26, on the low end of the scale though not quite as low as that of the Tesla Model S.

                            <b><p>The 2015 BMW i8 isn't as fast as most people presume, but its all-electric ability and remarkable efficiency redefine the word.</p></b>
                            Starting at the rear, a 231-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter three-cylinder engine puts out 236 lb-ft of torque through a six-speed automatic gearbox to power the rear wheels. Separately, a large 96-kilowatt (131-hp) electric motor sits between the front wheels, powering them through a two-speed transmission with energy from a lithium-ion battery pack mounted in the tunnel between the front passengers and providing 5.1 kilowatt-hours of usable capacity.
                            The 2015 i8 can be driven on electricity only through its front wheels, as a hybrid using both powertrains alternating as necessary, or in high-performance all-wheel-drive mode--with each method controlled by quite a lot of software to keep all the pieces operating harmoniously. BMW quotes a total power rating of 362 hp with both powertrains operating at maximum output, giving a 0-to-62-mph time of just 4.4 seconds.

                            <b><p>The 2015 BMW i8 is a well-built and comfortable touring coupe for two, but ignore the two rear seats.</p></b>
                            Entering the i8 takes a bit of training, since the bottom cushion of the seat is easily 6 or 8 inches below the level of the door sill. The passenger actually has the easier task, since there's no steering wheel to get in the way. Entering and exiting the driver's seat gets smoother with practice, but we left more than one scuff on the outer edge of the dashboard in the process--and drivers or passengers in dresses or short skirts will require an additional round of planning.
                            Once inside, the driver and passenger sit low in heavily contoured seats, with the tall center tunnel containing the battery pack separating them. The seats were comfortable over a few hours of travel, though we can't comment on their enduring comfort over a full day's driving. There's not a lot of storage space inside, though: the "wing doors" have no bins in them, for obvious reasons, and there's just a pair of shallow bins on top of the console, since the battery pack sits just underneath.

                             Otherwise, the BMW i8 coupe comes with the usual suite of safety equipment, including six airbags: a pair in the dash for front-seat occupants, side airbags in the backrests of the front seats, and side-curtain airbags to protect the heads of all passengers.One innovative safety feature is the world's first laser high-beam headlights, now offered on the i8 in Germany but not yet approved for sale in the U.S. A night-time demonstration of these lights, which have auto-dimming that senses the light of oncoming cars, appeared to give a clear, bright, almost daylight-quality pool of light for a far longer distance in front of the car than any other high beam we've experienced.

                            The i8 models on the test-drive event were all likely high-end models, with niceties like two-tone black and ivory leather upholstery, the bright-blue seat belts we liked so much--those we confirmed would be optional--and a full suite infotainment options, including a navigation system, satellite radio, and of course the smartphone app for controlling your i8 remotely.
                            An option that may or may not make it to the U.S. are the breathtaking, groundbreaking laser headlights, which would be a first in the market if BMW gets permission from the NHTSA to offer them. At the moment, the government agency is mulling whether to certify the new-technology headlights, which provide as close an approximation to clear white daylight in front of the car as anything we've seen--and come with auto-dimming that may be able to sense oncoming cars even before the driver.

                            BMW says the i8 coupe launches a "new era of sustainable performance," although the importance of fuel efficiency and sustainability to buyers of six-figure sports cars is debatable. Still, the light weight, advanced powertrain, and innovative materials--carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP) body shell and aluminum chassis--should make the BMW i8 an instant technology icon.
                            BMW quotes an electric range of up to 22 miles in "Max Emode", but the electric motor also provides "boost" to the engine when the car is running in its highest-performance "Sport" mode. The default mode, known as comfort, uses each powertrain or both in a more efficient manner, and the EPA rates the i8's total combined range between the charged battery and the gasoline tank at 330 miles.
