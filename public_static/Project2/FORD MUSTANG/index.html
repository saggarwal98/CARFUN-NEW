                    The 2018 Mustang is available in four trims—EcoBoost, EcoBoost Premium, GT, and GT Premium. The Mustang Convertible drops the standard GT trim. EcoBoost models rely on a new 2.3-liter, turbo-4 that generates 310 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque. The Mustang GT retains last year’s 5.0-liter V-8, which now packs 460 hp and 420 lb-ft of torque. Both engines work with standard 6-speed manual transmissions or optional 10-speed automatics.
                    Ford had launched the much anticipated Mustang at an introductory price of Rs 65 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) in India. The muscle car features a 5.0-litre, Ti-VCT V8 engine which churns out 401PS of power and 515Nm of torque.

                            2018 Mustang’s refresh focuses on the front and rear, leaving the bits in the middle largely unchanged. But rather than just updating the headlights, taillights, and front and rear bumpers—Ford addressed all that stuff—it made a larger change by lowering the height of the car’s nose, accentuating the shark-nose style. The change is minor, only about 20 millimeters, but it gives the Mustang’s face a different look.
                            Ford angled the new C-shaped taillights and seemingly slimmed down the black surround. It’s a subtler adjustment than what’s going on in front, but it still works. What doesn’t work is the available performance spoiler, a pedestal unit that looks cheap and bolted on. Thankfully, it’s only available with the Performance Package and Ford gives owners the option to delete the offensive aero piece at no charge.

                            Charming, powerful engine options, magnetic dampers that seamlessly switch between ride comfort and agility, stout brakes, and a wonderfully weighted steering rack yield a more complete, compelling Mustang. But a frustrating 10-speed automatic transmission ruins the perfect score.
                            The extra power makes the Mustang GT even more charming. Perfectly able to destroy its standard 18- or available 19-inch tires, it offers accessible power at every engine speed. But part of the charm comes from the new active exhaust system. Retaining the now-standard quad-tipped exhaust setup, the optional exhaust gives drivers the ability to adjust the exhaust volume on the fly. You can flip from a quiet setting perfect for cruising and commuting to a sonorous, sexy Track mode that probably is audible across entire counties.

                            <b><p>If you’re in the front seats of the 2018 Ford Mustang, life is good.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Ford Mustang is a two-plus-two in name, but not in function. The back seats can house a pair of humans for short stints (particularly with the convertible model’s roof down), but those chairs border on vestigial.
                            Once underway the cabin comes together well. Even the base seats offer a good range of adjustability, even for tall drivers, who will find plenty of leg and head room in front. A tilt/telescopic steering wheel complements the driver’s side setup.
                            <br>The center stack is a pleasant design, particularly in the Premium with its handsome toggle switches. The new carbon-fiber dash is an $1,195 option and adds a premium flair to the cabin, but it requires owners give up too much—you can’t get the Mustang’s main upgrade package or the Recaro seats with the carbon style pack. The Premium’s standard machined aluminum look is just fine, even though it’s just plastic.

                            The 2018 Mustang reserves the bulk of its active safety equipment for its EcoBoost Premium and GT Premium models. Grabbing either of those Mustang variants grants access to the Safe and Smart Package, a $1,495 goodie bag that adds adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alert, active lane control, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking and pedestrian detection, automatic high beams, and rain-sensing wipers. It also adds a memory function for the driver’s seat.
                            <br>Standard safety features include LED headlights, as well as front, side-curtain, and seat-mounted airbags (the side-curtain airbags are obviously not available with a convertible body). There’s also an airbag in place to protect the driver’s knee in the event of a crash.

Ford’s hilarious electronic line lock is standard on every car, allowing all 2018 Mustang owners to execute flawless burnouts at the push of a button and press of a pedal.
                            <br>That’s just the start. Both the Mustang EcoBoost and the Mustang GT are available with a Premium trim level, that adds heated and cooled front seats, leather upholstery, the Sync 3 infotainment system with an 8.0-inch touchscreen, and dual-zone automatic climate control. You’ll want the Premium trim as it opens access to one of the Mustang’s best new features.

                            The most efficient Mustang also will be the most common, with the 2.3-liter turbo-4, 10-speed automatic transmission, and hardtop body. It returns 21 mpg city, 32 highway, 25 combined.
                            But while the turbocharged, auto-equipped coupe is the most efficient, it’s very easy to order a Mustang that isn’t so kind at the pump. Grabbing the standard 6-speed manual drops the 2.3-liter Coupe’s fuel economy by 1 mpg on the highway.
                            Regardless of whether you go with the hardtop’s Performance Pack or the Convertible body style, the Mustang returns just 20/28/23 mpg with the auto—the stick sacrifices the same 1 mpg highway. The EPA hasn’t evaluated the Performance Pack-equipped Convertible.
