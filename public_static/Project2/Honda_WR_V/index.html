                <p><b>The 2018 Honda WR-V spaces out when it comes to economy-car goodness.</b></p><br>
                : Honda has launched a limited-run WR-V Alive Edition. Based on the base-spec S variant, the Honda WR-V Alive special edition comes with a few additional features and attracts a slight premium over the standard model.
                In a bid to boost the appeal of its WR-V crossover, Honda has just introduced a special edition of the model with a bit more equipment that enhances the vehicle's safety and comfort.
                Honda proudly claims that this sporty lifestyle vehicle was built entirely in-house at their Indian R&D facility. Targeted at the young urban buyer, Honda expects the WR-V to quench the thirst for a compact car that can handle city traffic along with higher ground clearance to tackle both city challenges and weekend adventures.
                Offered on the base S trim of the WR-V, the Alive edition is priced at  Rs 8.02 lakh for the petrol and Rs 9.11 lakh for the diesel. Both the versions are priced Rs 23,500 higher than the standard S variants. (All prices, ex-showroom, Delhi).

                        The cabin, drivetrain, platform, and certain body panels are shared. To put things in perspective, the WR-V has a 25mm longer wheelbase, is 44mm longer, 40mm wider, and 57mm taller than the Jazz. There’s a strong crossover trait thanks to the tough posture lent by the tall angular hood that holds the Honda signature chrome slab and sweptback head lamps, high ground clearance, deep creases on the panels and the cladding all across.
                        A rugged feel is brought about by the front fascia with the black cladding that also incorporates a silver skid plate. From the side, the WR-V shows off its larger 16-inch alloys with a high ground clearance (188mm over 165mm in Jazz), the roof rails and black cladding that extends over the wheel wells.
                        The rear end is highlighted by the new tailgate with a lowered number plate, longer tail lamps, and a heavily cladded bumper with a skid plate.

                        <b><p>Soul Of The Stunner</p></b>
                        The power to hold an audience comes from under the hood. The refined technology of WR-V gives it the full-bodied performance to match the urban road dasher in you.
                        WR-V gets the same 1.2-litre i-VTEC motor that produces 90bhp at 6,000rpm and 110Nm of torque at 4,800rpm. As of now, there are no plans to introduce the CVT gearbox in the petrol WR-V line-up. For now, Honda has coupled this engine to a new five-speed manual gearbox that’s equipped with shorter ratios to better the overall performance output from this engine. This can be seen in the ARAI fuel efficiency figures for the WR-V dropping from the Jazz’s 18.7kpl, to the new claim of 17.5kpl. It needs a note that the petrol WR-V also weighs up to 62kg more than the comparable Jazz.
                        WR-V is mostly eager to respond to throttle inputs, only at low speeds. It picks up pace in a linear fashion and as the momentum rises, you are left wanting for more especially in the mid-range.

                        Silver accents on black set the tone to groove on. Now press the start button, take charge of everything on the multi function steering and roll back the sunroof to let the sky zip by.
                        Slide onto the front seats and the first thing you’re reminded of, from the Jazz, is the airy cabin and good visibility due the large glass area.
                        These large front seats have a good design. However, the support isn’t the best since they are a bit too soft, especially around the contours, which in-turn don’t hold you in place when going fast around bends. Then again, there’s loads of headroom and kneeroom for tall occupants too. The WR-V doesn’t get magic seats, which Honda says, is a small trade-off for the inclusion of other features like the better infotainment system and the sunroof. 
                        The rear bench is big enough to fit three passengers and there’s lot of headroom too, but it’s short on thigh support. Again, with loads of legroom and a flat floor that’s slightly angled upwards, it makes the overall seating posture quite comfortable.

The WR-V also gets dual front airbags, ABS with EBD (electronic brakeforce distribution) and a multi-view rear parking camera with sensors.
                    The Honda WR-V has ACE body structure ,ECU immobilizer system for theft protection, Intelligent Pedals with brake override system. The Honda WR-V also comes equipped with impact migrating headrests to reduce damage in case of acciedent.
                    Additionally, WR-V customers also get a one-month subscription to Honda Connect. The app offers features such as service bookings, insurance and PUC reminders, impact alerts and trip analysis.
