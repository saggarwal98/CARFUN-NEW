                    <p><b>The 2018 Hyundai Tucson puts service ahead of sizzle, and caps it with an excellent warranty.</b></p><br>
                    The 2018 Hyundai Tucson is a compact crossover SUV in a crowded field. The small Hyundai uses a superlative warranty, good versatility, and ease of use to tempt shoppers.
                    The Tucson wears a well-tailored sheet metal suit, one without any cheap flaws or awkward lines. The grille’s a dead ringer for the front ends of other Hyundai crossovers, and from the side it’s a downsized clone of the long three-row Santa Fe. Inside, the carefully formatted cabin puts on hard plastic in base versions, but most others soften the trim, which brings out the design’s best curves and surfaces.
                    The starting price for the Tucson now starts at Rs 18.13 lakh for the base trim, as opposed to Rs 18.99 lakh pre-GST. That's a difference of Rs 86,000. The top variant now costs Rs 23.86 lakh against the previous price tag of Rs 25.01 lakh. Prices have been slashed across variants.

                            <b><p>The Tucson has simple lines and a well-organized interior.</p></b>
                            In its current edition, the Hyundai Tucson adopted a handsome set of curves that eliminated a lot of the busy surfaces of older versions.
                            The Tucson draws on the larger Santa Fe sport for inspiration. It has a relatively short glass area, but the big six-sided grille and geometrically defined headlights fit perfectly alongside Hyundai’s bigger crossover SUVs. On the more expensive versions, the Tucson adds 19-inch alloy wheels for a more imposing look.
                            <br>Inside, the Tucson has an conservative appearance and on most models, a good combination of textures and trim. Limited models, for example, have stitched trim atop their instrument binnacles.
                            The dash has a simple and elegant look, and it’s laid out with care. At its price point the Tucson could do much worse than the soft-touch surfaces that trim out most versions; base SE editions have a lot more hard plastic that reminds us of the early days of small SUVs.

                            <b><p>Lifeless steering and moderate turbo power are offset in the 2018 Hyundai Tucson by a well-damped ride.</p></b>
                            The Tucson doesn’t leave drivers with many choices. Once you lock in on an engine or a number of drive wheels, Hyundai figures out the rest for you.
                            The Tucson's ride and handling err more on the side of predictability than outright sportiness, which is typical for this segment. A MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear setup deliver a fairly firm ride with the optional 19-inch wheels in Sport and Limited trim levels. That ride quality can turn downright jarring, at least momentarily, over, say, expansion strips or rutted pavement. 
                            Despite being light on sportiness, Tucson crossovers with all-wheel drive include torque vectoring that improves cornering performance. It does so by braking the inside rear wheel and delivering additional torque to the outside rear wheel.

                            <b><p>Rivals have more cargo room, but the Tucson has well-shaped seats for four people.</p></b>
                            The Tucson grows a little each time Hyundai redesigns it. In its current form, it’s a bit smaller than crossovers like the Honda CR-V, but Hyundai makes the most of it with a clean design and good seats.
                            In front, the driver and passenger get comfortable, well-bolstered chairs on all trim levels; only the base SE lacks a power-adjustable driver chair. The passenger-side seat can be adjusted for height, but only the Limited gives it power control.
                            In back, the Tucson can carry two adults in good comfort, so long as you recline the seat to a normal position. Otherwise, the seatback sits quite upright. There’s plenty of space for tall passengers and good knee and head room, but to stuff a third person in the second row, you’ll need some sort of signature on a waiver.

                        <b><p>The Tucson fares well in crash tests, but Hyundai severely limits availability of the latest safety technology.</p></b>
                        Federal and independent testers give the Hyundai Tucson high marks.The current Tucson earned five stars overall from the NHTSA. The IIHS calls it a Top Safety Pick.
                        However, only the most expensive model has forward-collision warnings and automatic emergency braking. It missed out on a perfect score from the NHTSA with its sole four-star rollover resistance rating. The IIHS thinks the headlights have room for improvement, so it missed out on a Top Safety Pick+ nod.
                        Value and Limited-edition Tucsons have blind-spot monitors on top of the standard rearview camera. Limited models also have lane-departure warnings and parking sensors.
                        3 point seat belt ensures improved safety for rear center passenger as compared to conventional 2 point seat belt.

                            Hyundai sells the Tucson in five trim levels: SE, SEL, SEL Plus, Value, and Limited trims.All deliver a reasonable amount of equipment, but none offers much in the way of options or innovation.
                            The base Tucson SE has the base 4-cylinder and automatic, as well as power features, air conditioning, cruise control, a rearview camera, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a 5.0-inch touchscreen for its infotainment system. It’s the only Tucson still sold with a CD player, in case you won’t let the 1990s die.
                            The SEL adds power adjustable driver's seat, heated front seats, a 7.0-inch screen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as HD and satellite radio.SEL Plus models share this gear, but have dual climate controls, LED lights, and an 8.0-inch touchscreen.

                            The Hyundai Tucson crossover SUV earns higher EPA ratings than in the past, and fuel economy on its uprated turbo-4 engine is good.
                            The entry-level Tucson sports a 164-hp 2.0-liter inline-4 and a 6-speed automatic. The EPA rates this front-drive model was pegged at 23 mpg city, 30 highway, 26 combined. All-wheel-drive models were rated at 21/26/23 mpg.
                            With the 175-hp 1.6-liter turbo-4 and 7-speed dual-clutch transmission, the Tucson Sport and Limited models with front-wheel drive were rated at 25/30/27 mpg. With all-wheel drive, those models are pegged at 24/28/25 mpg.
