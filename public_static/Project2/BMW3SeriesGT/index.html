                    <p><b>One of the ultimate grand-tourers, the BMW 3-Series stands ready to eat up miles, buyers' budgets, and premium unleaded.</b></p><br>
                    The BMW 3 Series Gran Turismo is a tall, entry-level luxury four-door hatchback that was introduced for 2014. It seats five and it's more than 7 inches longer than the standard BMW 3 Series wagon, a difference that adds up to more rear legroom and cargo capacity. Two trim levels are available: 328i xDrive and 335i xDrive. The 328i GT comes with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine rated at 240 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. The more powerful 335i has a 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder engine rated at 300 hp and 300 lb-ft of torque. An eight-speed automatic transmission is standard, as is all-wheel drive.
                    The German car manufacturer BMW 3 Series GT in India has a starting price of Rs 43.30 lakh, ex-Delhi for the base, Sport Line diesel (320d) variant. In addition to this, BMW has launched two variants, the Luxury Line diesel and the Luxury Line petrol (330i). Prices for these variants start at Rs 46.50 lakh and 47.50 lakh (ex-Delhi) respectively.

                            A stature defined through its muscularity combined with the flowing roof line of classic coupés. The result is the unmistakeable and captivating design of the BMW Gran Turismo. Precise contours and expressively sculptured surfaces form a fascinating interplay of light and shade. And the light design at the front and rear emphasises the sporty and powerful appearance.
                            High-quality materials combine with a thoughtful, if plain, design to earn this car top scores.
                            The BMW Gran Turismo captivates its beholders with the very first glimpse. The elongated bonnet and the pointed contours from C pillar to the car body impart a dynamic forward thrust. In the side view, the frameless windows and the flowing roof line emphasise the classic sporty coupé character, while the L-shaped lights at the rear underline the broad shape of the vehicle.

At the same time, intelligent measures from BMW EfficientDynamics and the unique BMW TwinPower Turbo technology guarantee a supreme level of efficiency – for maximum performance with less fuel consumption and fewer emissions.

                            Inside, the BMW 3 Series GT is as classy and comfortable as any other 3 Series model. The look and feel of the cabin is characterized by high-quality materials on most surfaces and a simple, functional layout. Although the standard 6.5-inch display screen is adequate, the larger, optional screen is a worthwhile upgrade for shoppers desiring a premium electronics interface. This version of the iDrive system includes a touchpad (on top of the main controller) that can be used to hand write inputs using your finger. Overall, iDrive is pretty easy to use and notable for its quick processing times, though some tasks require a few more twirls and clicks than we'd like. Of course, the 3 Series Gran Turismo's real specialty lies in the back half of the interior. With its impressive backseat legroom and 56.5 cubic feet of cargo capacity, it's a viable option for camping and vacationing.
