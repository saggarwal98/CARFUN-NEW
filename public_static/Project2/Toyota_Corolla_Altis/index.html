                    The 2018 Toyota Corolla is the white bread of new cars. Satisfying sustenance without much excitement; a car that does its job with only the occasional hint of flair.  
                    The latest Corolla rolls into 2018 largely identical, aside from the deletion of a 50th anniversary special edition (51st anniversary doesn’t have quite the same ring). Illuminated vanity mirrors are now standard on all models, while XLE and SE models add a leather-wrapped, three-spoke steering wheel to their roster of equipment.
                    Toyota Corolla Altis prices start at Rs. 15.70 lakh for petrol and goes upto Rs. 19.92 lakh. The prices of Corolla Altis diesel variants start at Rs. 17.16 lakh and the top-end diesel is priced at Rs. 18.81 lakh. Toyota Corolla Altis is available in 6 variants and 7 colours.

                            <b><p>It's not bad inside, but the Toyota Corolla somehow manages to be awkward without being interesting outside.</p></b>
                            Always something of a wallflower, the Toyota Corolla isn’t exactly the kind of car that’s going to make you stand out in a parking lot. For many of us, that’s just fine.
                            L and LE trim levels are the humblest of the group, with plastic hubcaps covering their steel wheels and little in the way of exterior adornment. SE and XSE trim levels stand out more with their stylish alloy wheels and a few revisions to their front and rear bumpers. They’re not quite sporty, though, given how high they sit. In the real world, that’s fine since the Corolla has an unusually high 6.7 inches of ground clearance.
                            Inside, a nearly vertical dashboard presents all controls in a logical, easy to sort through manner. It’s not the most stylish look, but the Corolla’s interior is nicely done with interesting use of blue lighting, attractive seat fabrics on most models and pleasant contrasting stitching running across the dashboard’s edges.

                            <b><p>It won't thrill you, but the Toyota Corolla rides and handles well enough.</p></b>
                            All Corolla models are powered by versions of a 1.8-liter inline-4 engine; most you’ll find on dealer lots will be equipped with a CVT, but a 6-speed manual can be had on the Corolla SE sedan and on the Corolla iM hatchback. The 1.8-liter puts out 132 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque in most versions of the sedan; the LE Eco uses a special valve timing system to save fuel that has the pleasant side effect of adding 8 hp (albeit at the expense of 2 lb-ft). The Corolla iM’s version of this motor is rated at 137 hp and 126 lb-ft, but we wouldn’t get too lost in the numbers if we were you. In terms of acceleration, all are adequate. The CVT forces them to spend a lot of time at higher engine speeds, but ample sound deadening and a decent stereo should keep most engine rumble at bay.The Corolla’s steering is light with minimal feedback from the road. It gets the job done with confidence, but it’s not there to play.

                            <b><p>The Toyota Corolla's interior is roomy and its seats are comfortable, but it feels a litlte low budget for the price.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Toyota Corolla checks all the right boxes inside on paper, but doesn’t feel as nice as its high sticker price asks buyers to pay.
                            All models have a height-adjustable driver’s seat; it’s power-adjusted on Corolla XLE and XSE models, which also feature synthetic leather upholstery that doesn’t quite feel like the real McCoy but should wear better over time. Both front seats are supportive and moderately bolstered. There’s good leg room in the rear, although three abreast is a little tight for extended trips.
                            There’s plenty of shiny, overly grained plastic trim where some rivals have put in a muted metallic or a soft-touch panel. Additionally, the infotainment system in the Corolla iM isn’t integrated especially well into its dash, looking instead like an aftermarket unit bought at a big box electronics retailer. Lower-end versions of the Corolla are littered with switch blanks inside, a reminder that you could have spent more.

                        <b><p>One of the most compelling reasons to consider a Corolla is for its safety equipment and crash-test scores.</p></b>
                        The 2018 Toyota Corolla is an exceptionally safe small car, regardless of which model buyers select. We commend its high level of standard safety equipment and both federal and independent testers have praised its crashworthiness.
                        Every Corolla is equipped with a high level of safety tech: LED headlights, automatic emergency braking that can detect pedestrians and vehicles, automatic high beams, and lane departure warnings in addition to expected features like eight airbags and stability control. Corolla sedans also include adaptive cruise control.
                        The IIHS rates the Corolla a Top Safety Pick thanks both to all that equipment and to their crashworthiness in the event of an accident.The NHTSA says that the Corolla rates five stars overall, although it scores four stars in the frontal collision test and four for rollover.

                            <b><p>The base Corolla isn't so basic any more and top-of-the-line models feel reasonably special.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Toyota Corolla is offered in two body configurations and more than half a dozen trim levels. Even at the bottom end, it is well-equipped and while the range-topping Corolla XLE and XSE models don’t feel like mini-Bentleys, they aren’t missing much, either.
                            The Corolla L is the gateway to this lineup. It’s only offered in a limited number of colors and has the look and feel of a model destined for lease special ads on the radio. But it’s not a bare bones car: a 6.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system with USB and aux input jacks, a rearview camera, air conditioning, adaptive cruise control, power windows and locks, and Bluetooth are all standard.
                            The Corolla LE and LE Eco add automatic climate control, a flop-down armrest integrated into the rear seat back, a 3.5-inch TFT screen in the instrument cluster, and keyless entry.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Toyota Corolla is thrifty, if not quite the thriftiest.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Toyota Corolla is fuel efficient, but lacks hardware that others use to push it to the top of its class.The 6-speed manual Corolla SE, an admittedly rare bird, is thirstier yet: 27/35/30 mpg.
                            But things turn around with the Corolla LE Eco. Its more efficient version of the standard Corolla’s 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine combines with special tires to produce much better numbers: 30/40/34 mpg with 15-inch wheels and 29/38/33 mpg with the optional 16s.
                            Not bad. Also, not great. Several competitors top 40 mpg on the highway without forcing buyers to seek out a special efficiency-oriented model with low rolling resistance tires that may not be great in wet climes.
