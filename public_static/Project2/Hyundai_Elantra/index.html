                    <p><b>The 2018 Hyundai Elantra adds a versatile hatchback to the fold and makes a more compelling case as a compact contender in a value-packed segment.</b></p><br>
                    The 2018 Hyundai Elantra is all elbows, as far as we’re concerned. Only a few years ago it was lost in the compact car melange, a medley of middling econobox mishaps.
                    Now, the Elantra is a fully fledged competitor with a recent history of delivering sharp style, a spacious cabin, and strong features at a reasonable price.
                    The 2018 Hyundai Elantra GT joins the lineup as a hatchback model but its name is somewhat deceiving—it's not directly related to the Elantra sedan.
                    The Elantra GT’s steering is light, but precise, and the hatchback feels planted—albeit a little heavy—in cornering. These are mostly good things, and the comparison to a Volkswagen GTI is a fair one to make.
                    Hyundai Elantra Variants. Hyundai Elantra prices start at Rs. 12.99 lakh for petrol and goes upto Rs. 18.10 lakh. The prices of Elantra diesel variants start at Rs. 14.79 lakh and the top-end diesel is priced at Rs. 19.19 lakh.

                            <b><p>The Elantra is handsome, but not as adventurous as it once was.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Hyundai Elantra isn’t as bold as its predecessors, but it doesn’t really need to be. Hyundai isn’t fighting for attention like it once was, and the new Elantra GT reflects that attitude.
                            Starting with the more popular sedan, it carves a cleaner hole in the air. The grille is lower and wider than older cars, which helps the Elantra announce itself on the road.
                            The sedan has deeper lines across the doors, but it melds with the fenders and roofline in a better way than it has in previous years.
                            By comparison, the Elantra GT swaps out the large trapezoidal grille with a pinched version and a mesh insert. The headlights are more hawkish, with a different lamp assembly than the sedan. The hatchback doesn’t get the same LED daytime running light treatment that the sedan gets, and we wish it did.
                            Around back, the sedan uses a trio of taillights and an upturned decklid to finish off its shape, while the hatchback blurs its lines with a rounder affair for the rear.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Hyundai Elantra has athletic intentions—they just fall closer to marathoner than sprinter.</p></b>
                            Although Hyundai offers the 2018 Elantra and Elantra GT with sportier siblings, its performance is firmly in the middle of the competition.
                            The Elantra sedan offers three engine choices, while the Elantra GT stands pat at two. The base version is a 2.0-liter inline-4 that makes 147 horsepower (162 hp in the Elantra GT) and 137 pound-feet of torque (150 lb-ft in the Elantra GT). A 6-speed manual transmission is standard equipment in both models, but will probably be a rare sight on lots. A 6-speed automatic is more likely and its predisposed to conserve fuel. Tipping the gear selector over lets drivers select their own cog and bring to life the engine.
                            The sedan and hatchback also share a 1.6-liter turbo-4 in Sport trims that adds plenty of pep. The busy turbo-4 improves power by more than 25 percent, all the way up to 201 hp and 195 lb-ft, which can be shuffled through a smooth shifting 7-speed dual-clutch automatic or—our pick—a 6-speed manual.

                            <b><p>Sneaky big and sneaky quiet, the 2018 Hyundai Elantra’s secret is its relative comfort.</p></b>
                            While the 2018 Hyundai Elantra may be considered as a small car, the tale of the tape plants it in the “mid-size” weight class on interior dimensions.
                            The sedan rides on a similarly sized wheelbase as before, but slightly longer overall. Just like the last version, the sedan is more pleasant for driver and front-seat passenger, with more comfortable seats and more comfortable bolsters on the bottom seat cushion. Sport models get deeper buckets with grippier cloth, or optional leather.
                            Front passengers get a wealth of storage opportunities with numerous cubbies and cupholders and a deep, covered bin ahead of the shift lever.
                            Rear-seat riders don’t get the same comfortable cushions, but plenty of head and knee room. The sedan’s rear seats ride lower than before, but the tradeoff is worth it: 6-footers will have plenty of head room.

                        <b><p>The 2018 Elantra performs well in IIHS testing, but the feds came up with different results.</p></b>
                        The IIHS calls the sedan a Top Safety Pick+ thanks to good scores on its crash tests, excellent advanced safety systems, and available headlights.
                        Federal regulators have different ideas. The sedan is earned a relatively rare four-star overall score and a rare note on the side-impact passenger side crash test that the impact touched the rear dummy. The new Elantra GT was rated identically.
                        The optional suite includes blind-spot monitors, active lane control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control.
                        To get the headlights that the IIHS rated “Good” also requires an optional extra, only on the Limited trim as well. All other trims get standard halogen projectors that have been rated “Poor” by the IIHS.
                        All Elantra sedans come with stability control, a driver knee airbag, and a driver-side blind-spot mirror.

                            The 2018 Hyundai Elantra starts at a modest $17,835 with reasonable equipment for that price. The sedan is equipped with 15-inch wheels, a six-speaker audio system, manual transmission, cloth upholstery, 3.5-inch LCD screen, and a handshake.
                            Most buyers will start with the Elantra SEL that swaps in a 7.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, 16-inch wheels, cruise control, Bluetooth—you know, 2017 features. It starts at $1,900 more than the manual-equipped base model and includes an automatic transmission.
                            For 2018, Hyundai coalesced its Popular trim package on SE models into a new trim level, called SEL. It’s still a good value in the segment, but competitors such as Honda and Toyota are catching up.
                            Sport models are trimmed similarly to Limited versions, but offer a more potent engine and the same optional features as Limited models.

                            According to the EPA, most Elantra sedans will manage 28 mpg city, 37 highway, 32 combined with a 2.0-liter inline-4 and 6-speed automatic.
                            Elantra SE models don’t have as many features and are rated separately at 29/38/33 mpg. Elantra Eco models manage slightly better fuel economy, but require a tempered right foot to keep the 1.4-liter off boost, and earn a 32/40/35 mpg rating by the EPA. Elantra Sport sedans fall hard from the perch and are rated at 22/30/25 mpg.
                            Automatic-equipped hatchbacks are rated at 24/32/27 mpg, while manual-equipped sport hatchbacks are 22/29/25 mpg, according to the EPA.
