                    <p><b>The 2018 Honda Jazz Facelift spaces out when it comes to economy-car goodness.</b></p><br>
                    The Jazz offers a versatile interior, good gas mileage, an entertaining drive, and good safety equipment.
                    The Jazz’s a tall hatchback, nearly as tall as the HR-V crossover Honda spins from some of the same hardware. Yet the Jazz has a minivan-like shape that makes the most of its footprint. A crease here, a fold there, the Jazz’s shape does nothing foul or exceedingly fair. The cabin seems a bit busy, but functions well enough. Our biggest complaint is the durable stuff Honda uses to cover the dash and doors.
                    Honda Jazz prices start at Rs. 7.35 lakh for petrol and goes upto Rs. 8.99 lakh. The prices of Jazz diesel variants start at Rs. 8.05 lakh and the top-end diesel is priced at Rs. 9.29 lakh.

                            <b><p>The Honda Jazz doesn’t get many second looks.</p></b>
                            The mini-minivan silhouette of the Jazz bears some details that cut the shape down to size. There’s a deep crease stamped low on its sides, which makes it appear longer than it really is. The windshield has a steep rake, and the hood is short and stubby, but the Jazz still looks good on its 15-inch base or 16-inch upgrade wheels. Big taillights run down from the top of its hatch into the bumpers in a way that Volvo wouldn’t find unfamiliar. If it were our call, we’d paint in body color the matte-chrome bar incised across the Jazz’s rear.
                            The relative restraint that Honda's designers kept to for its exterior was mostly thrown away inside, where things are a little too ambitious. An ultra-busy instrument panel is loaded with shapes, pieces, trims, bezels, and surfaces that can feel a little haphazard. While nothing looks and feels especially low-rent, the Jazz pales in comparison to the simpler look offered by the Honda HR-V, a small crossover derived from the Jazz.

                            Power in the Jazz comes from a 1.5-liter inline-4. With 130 horsepower and 114 pound-feet of torque, the 4-cylinder has direct injection that helps it post fuel economy in the 30s, on the EPA combined scale. It’s unremarkable in other ways, save for the gruff engine noises that have worked their way into the cabin in recent model years. Power starts to taper off above 4,000 rpm, right where the available CVT finds its sweet spot. 
                            The first Jazz’s delightfully light and quick steering and tightly controlled body motions were traded in on a more compliant ride and less quick and communicative steering in this generation. Honda says it’s beefed up the Jazz’s steering rack for better isolation.

                            The Honda Jazz is either blessed or cursed with a small footprint and an inexpensively furnished cabin, depending on how you look at it. What’s immutably true is that Honda does the absolute best job of packaging the Jazz, of extracting every cubic centimeter of space and making it more flexible than rivals.
                            The Jazz does a better job at moving its seats around and creating space than it does at coddling the people who sit in it. The front seats have thin cushions, and don’t have as much space as those in the second row, a very rare occurrence. The passenger-side footwell is blocked in by a curve that forces legs to the side, a position that will grow tiring during a long trip.
                            The back seat is more comfortable. Tall passengers can pair up back there with very good leg and head room. The tall doors permit graceful entry and exit, too.

                        The Honda Jazz has a blemish on its crash-test ratings, but perhaps to compensate for it, the hatchback gets some advanced safety additions for the 2018 model year.
                        This year, Honda added to the Jazz’s array of features such as hill-start assist and rearview camera. A package of safety equipment is now an option on the Jazz LX and standard across the rest of the range. It includes adaptive cruise control, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, lane-departure warnings and active lane control.
                        Jazz 2018 comes with safety features like standard Dual airbags, ABS with EBD and Rear Parking Sensor and Camera to name a few. ACETM Body structure and pedestrian injury mitigation technology minimizes injuries in the event of a collision.

                            Honda stocks the Jazz with a decent set of standard features, but limits options into a few bundles and trim lines.
                            Every Jazz comes with power locks and windows, keyless entry, air conditioning, a rearview camera, cruise control, a 5.0-inch touchscreen with an AM/FM audio system, Bluetooth with audio streaming, and a USB port. Its base price sits about $1,000 higher than rivals, but not when features are equalized.
                            The Jazz Sport gets its own front and rear ends, orange pinstripes, 16-inch black wheels, and an orange-striped black interior. It also has a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.  
                            The Jazz doesn’t offer much in the way of option packages or custom touches. Choose a color—orange is new this year—and a trim level, and move on to the dealer-installed accessories.

                            The 1.2L i-VTEC petrol engine strikes a perfect balance by providing an impressive power of 90 ps combined with a mileage of 18.2 Km/l in the manual transmission.
                            The 1.5L i-DTEC Diesel Engine, highly fuel efficient diesel engine, gives an unparalleled mileage of 27.3 Km/l and max power of 100 ps. Available in the new 6 Speed MT, it’s an all aluminium construction that runs on low friction technology and thus, lets you explore the farthest corners with perfect efficiency.
                            Continuously Variable Transmission is Honda innovation at its best. This original Honda CVT is developed as part of ‘Earth Dreams Technology’.
