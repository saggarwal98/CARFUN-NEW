        <p style="margin-left:280px;margin-right:260px;">The classic Honda City contour is unmistakable but the surprises will thrill you too. It is a design vision that echoes the City’s blue blooded sedan charm. A look that adds panache and exhilaration to the game. It is an overpowering presence that meets a brand new attitude.</p>

                    <p><b>The 2018 Honda City sedan should be at the top of any four-door shoppers’ lists—sedan or otherwise. It’s well-crafted, comfortable, and affordable.</b></p><br>
                    Honda built its four-wheeled automotive empire on the back of small cars, flying in the face of 1970s convention that bigger was better. As the ubiquitous Civic grew larger and larger, a niche for a smaller car appeared, and that niche was subsequently filled by the City in sedan guise, and the Jazz hatch that sits alongside it.
                    The interior, too, is spacious and airy, while the controls and steering wheel give the City an upmarket feel. There’s a little too much grey plastic inside, and hard plastics aren’t difficult to spot, but the City presents well, on the whole.
                    The Honda City iVTEC S is now priced at Rs 8.46 lakh, as opposed to Rs 8.62 lakh pre-GST.

                            <b><p>On-trend angles and traditional proportions merge to make the 2018 Honda City one of the best-looking mainstream sedans that we’ve seen in a while.</p></b>
                            The City does a good job of disguising the fact that it’s a micro-sized sedan; at first glance, the revised front bar and grille that’s meant to mimic the one on the new Civic does such a good job that some people will need to look at the bootlid badge to find out it’s not a Civic.
                            A high waistline and a solid yet stylish sweep over the roof keep the City from looking overly twee, and even though the 16-inch wheels look a bit narrow, the overall impression is one of a larger car.
                            The City clearly has moved up and the update that it had got was a much needed one that has made it much better looking. The new City still maintains its cores strengths but now is more premium. First of all the styling makes it much more aggressive and it stands out amongst rivals. It carries off the bold look well and I like the bigger headlamps with the equally big grille and a nice chunk of chrome in the middle while the front bumper is sharply cut.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Honda City handles its available power with grace and ease. When did “fine” become a pejorative?</p></b>
                            The top shelf VTi-L is the best of a two-model lineup, and costs $21,590 plus on-road costs. It comes with an 88kW 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine and a continuously variable transmission driving the front wheels, as well as LED daytime lamps, a part-leather interior, push-button start and smart key, climate control air conditioning, 16-inch alloys and a 7.0-inch touchscreen multimedia system with sat nav and Bluetooth phone and audio streaming.
                            Honda knows how to do petrol engines. The 1.5l motor makes 118 bhp and 145Nm. Thus paired with a 5-speed manual, this is the most fun City to buy. Of course the CVT version makes sense but the manual is also quite easy to drive. First of all using it in the, um, city, it feels relaxed and does not lack torque.

                            The interior, too, is spacious and airy, while the controls and steering wheel give the City an upmarket feel. There’s a little too much grey plastic inside, and hard plastics aren’t difficult to spot, but the City presents well, on the whole.
                            A regular gear shifter and manual handbrake means the two cupholders are squashed under the centre console, but there are bottle holders in all four doors, as well as two more cupholders in the rear centre armrest in the VTi-L.
                            The craftsmanship in the new City creates thoughtful interiors on the Man Maximum, Machine Minimum philosophy. A grand cabin space with ample legroom, rear AC vents,an ergonomically designed cockpit, all come together to make your ride truly classy.
                            Convenience is ingrained in every angle in the new City. As you comfortably settle in, you will find various nooks and corners that tuck in your world along with you.

                            <b><p>A wide array of standard safety gear and good crash test scores are assets for the 2018 Honda City.</p></b>                            
                            Every Honda car takes great pride in bringing the most updated safety practices. 
                            Multiview Rear Parking Camera keeps every bit of the new City safe from scratches and dents. Auto Headlamps with Auto-Off Timer provide added safety. Rain Sensing Wipers keep driving uninterrupted and a sudden change in weather and visibility during rain is no longer a threat to safety.
                            While it was always the safest car, the new City takes safety to a new level by introducing six airbags. Testimony to Honda’s commitment to creating a safer driving experience in every car.
                            The rear camera display is decent and has 3 viewing angles plus one issue is at night, with the USB ports not backlit, plugging in the USB or even my phone was an issue. 
                            As mentioned, the City misses out on AEB and other driver aids, but does offer emergency brake assist and emergency flashing brake lights, as well as hill-start assist.

                            <b><p>Good features abound, but the 2018 Honda City is best at extremes: base or fully loaded.</p></b>
                            It does miss out on a lot of other stuff, though, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, automatic lights (remember when a car last beeped at you to turn off the lights? Me neither...) and automatic wipers, and it also misses out on driver aids like auto emergency braking (AEB).
                            The City now gets some interesting additions. While usual features like satellite-linked navigation, voice recognition, Mirror link, climate control, rear ac vents, LED lamps, sunroof are there, it now has Wi-Fi support for Internet and 1.5 GB internal memory which is cool.
                            Every detail should make it’s mark. Every glint of chrome should shine the path ahead. That is the 
legacy of a City and it’s one that will always be ahead of its time. The craftsmanship of a City is an ode to Honda’simpeccable standards. And yet there are finer points that could be tweaked to personal benefits.

                            The underdone performance does offer a benefit at the petrol pump, with the City returning a claimed 5.9 litres per 100km on the combined fuel economy cycle.
                            A 320km test loop netted us a dash-indicated figure of 6.3 litres per 100km, which is impressively close.
                            The handling is good but again its not the manic enthusiast friendly car as the raised ground clearance and nod towards being more appealing to a wider audience, means it is according to class standard. In terms of efficiency I got 10.8 kmpl in city while highway use increased it to 12-13 kmpl.
