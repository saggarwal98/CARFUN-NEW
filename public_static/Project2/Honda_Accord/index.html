                    The 2018 Honda Accord mid-size sedan isn't just a redo, it's a rethink. After milquetoast versions of the mid-sizer in previous years, a new four-door arrived this year.
                    The new sedan boasts a bevy of upscale features including a 10-speed automatic, soft leathers, wood dash accents, interior noise cancellation, LED headlights, advanced safety features, and an elegant 8.0-inch touchscreen.
                    Accord Hybrid is priced at Rs 37 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), which is around Rs 6 lakh pricier as that of its arch rival Toyota Camry hybrid. Propelling to ninth generation, it encompass a host of cosmetic changes over the previous model retailed in India.

                            The 2018 Honda Accord sheds its frumpy past in search of right angles and hard edges for the future. It’s a look that other Asian-based automakers have attempted, but few have succeeded in so far.
                            From the nose, the Accord appears to have borrowed Toyota and Nissan’s protractor—and Acura’s playbook. While we see an Acura-like beak in the Accord’s nose, it’s actually better than that. The lines are drawn from the sides of the headlights into the Accord’s upper lip in a way that reads smaller than it is in person. A chrome grille adds some unnecessary flair, but the whole design isn’t too overwrought.
                            n profile, the Accord tempts with a sportback shape (that we wish they’d finish) with a stretched rear roofline that arches back toward the end without much of a trunk lid. It borrows from other sedans that have found sportback models, and looks similarly handsome.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Honda Accord handles its available power with grace and ease. When did “fine” become a pejorative?</p></b>
                            Performance is relative in the 2018 Honda Accord. While it boasts an engine borrowed from Honda’s hottest hatchback in years and it sports manual transmissions across the lineup, speed was never the Honda Accord’s mission.
                            Four out of five Honda Accords on the road will feature a 1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 that makes 192 horsepower and 192 pound-feet of torque. Mated to either a 6-speed manual or continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), this Accord doesn’t hide its pedestrian intentions. The engine is tuned toward low-end grunt, an unintended consequence of swapping in fuel-efficient turbochargers. Off-the-line acceleration may fool drivers into believing that the base turbo-4 has more gusto than it does—that’s OK. Deep stabs at the throttle will reveal that the turbo-4 runs out of ideas somewhat quickly, and adding the manual transmission only makes it worse.

                            The 2018 Honda Accord’s best quality may be that it’s far better than it needs to be.
                            The Honda Accord makes best use of its shape by maximizing interior room. Although the sedan has a longer wheelbase that’s also wider and lower to the ground, the overall length bumper-to-bumper is down 2 inches from last year’s model.
                            The extra length between the wheels goes to rear seat passengers who get more than 40 inches of leg room in the back. Two 6-footers can sit behind two other 6-footers. 
                            <br>Active noise cancellation is standard on all trims and includes a third microphone placed in the rear of the car to void noises coming from the road or engine. EX and higher models are fitted with wheel resonators that quash noise coming from tires.

                            While every Honda car takes great pride in bringing the most updated safety features, the Accord Hybrid takes safety to the level of art. Not only is the Accord designed to safeguard you, it goes miles ahead to safeguard every bit of craftsmanship that you will cherish in it.
                            The system, which the automaker calls “HondaSensing,” includes forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, active lane control, and adaptive cruise control. It’s on every model, built into the entry price, and it’s a great addition.
                            The IIHS says that the Accord earns a Top Safety Pick award. It's held back from the top score thanks to its headlights, which rate "Acceptable" on most trim levels but just "Marginal" on the range-topping Accord Touring. Better headlights would earn it a Top Safety Pick+ award.

                            The 2018 Honda Accord strikes out on a different path for mid-size sedans this year. The Accord eschews the typical formula of 4- and 6-cylinder engine choices for a trio of inline-4s.
                            The base engine is a 1.5-liter turbo-4 borrowed from the smaller Civic sedan. The EPA rates it at 30 mpg city, 38 highway, 33 combined when paired to the continuously variable transmission. 
                            A larger, 2.0-liter turbo-4 is available on top-trim models isn't as efficient. When paired to a 10-speed automatic, the EPA rates it at 23/34/27 mpg. In Sport or Touring trims it's rated at 22/32/26 mpg.
