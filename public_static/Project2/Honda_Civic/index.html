                    <p><b>The 2018 Honda Civic is a good car made better by plenty of options and value at nearly every stop.</b></p><br>
                    Honda makes available the compact car in a sedan, coupe, or hatchback body, with a trio of turbocharged engines (and one naturally aspirated version) and a grip of automatic or manual transmissions. Two common themes, regardless of body style or engine: a good ride and great fuel economy.
                    The LX trim level signifies a base version of coupe or sedan, with EX, EX-L, EX-T, and Touring grades increasing niceties and price along the way. Trim levels with the “T” appendage denote an optional, uprated turbocharged engine; trims with an “L” in their name denote leather upholstery. 
                    Price of the Honda Civic price can anywhere around Rs. 15 to 18 lakh for the manual transmission versions and the automatic transmission version would cost around Rs. 20 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi).

                            The Civic spans three body styles, with moderate levels of flair or class all the way up. Sedans will be the most popular sight on roadways and it’s one of the better drawn four-doors we’ll see. The sedan is more formal than prior generations of the Civic and busier than other models in the Honda family.
                            Along the sides, big wheel wells meet deeply surfaced sills and gracefully arched rear arches; the gently sloping roofline reaches the tail without any buttress frippery or untoward behavior. It’s acceptable in almost every configuration.
                            The hatchback takes all of the cues from the sedan and coupe from the rear door forward, but the rear is all its own. It’s 2 inches shorter overall than the sedan, although it doesn’t ruin the proportions.

                            <b><p>Pedestrian to punk rock, the 2018 Honda Civic has a wide variety of powertrains to satisfy. There’s a common thread: a very capable and quiet ride.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Honda Civic has a range of turbocharged engines that transform the car from a capable commuter to a powerful performer.
                            Base versions of the Civic coupe and sedan get a 2.0-liter inline-4 that’s rated at 158 horsepower mated to either a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) or a 6-speed manual. It’s not particularly thrilling in any application, but it’s a commuter special that will fade into the background for most daily slogs.
                            The CVT uses a system of gears and pulleys to simulate one gear that adjusts engine speed for maximum efficiency—and in some cases, power. That kind of transmission can sometimes drone, or feel like a rubber band, in bad applications; fade into the background in good applications.

                            <b><p>Rethink what you know about the Honda Civic—it’s no longer the small car you may remember.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Honda Civic wraps a compact shape around a mid-size cabin that’s longer, lower, and wider than before.
                            Inside, the Civic makes good use of its smart packaging and lower dash structure, which helps open up the cabin. The front seats are thinner than before, with deeper sculpting for our rumps and ample leg room up front. Taller drivers shouldn’t want for space in any models—our leggiest editors at 6-foot-3 could extend the driver’s seat well beyond the reach of their feet. 
                            In back, the Civic will accommodate two full-size adults with ease, although coupe models are predictably not suited well for the task. Sedans sport the most rear leg room of the bunch (37.4 inches) followed by hatchback models (36 inches) and the coupe (35.9 inches). Three abreast in the back is acceptable, but not preferred for long trips.

                        Honda offers its active safety suite, dubbed Honda Sensing, on all four-door models for $1,000 extra. The system is standard on Touring and Sport Touring models.
                        Honda Sensing adds adaptive cruise control, lane-departure warnings, and forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking. The IIHS gave the system its top “Superior” rating at avoiding crashes.
                        Federal regulators and the IIHS give the Civic top scores all the way around for crashworthiness. The IIHS gave the Civic “Good” scores across the board, including the small overlap crash test, which simulates a car striking a light pole or other small object at 40 mph.

                            The news for the 2018 Honda Civic’s fuel economy ranges from good to great. Nearly all models manage around 35 mpg combined—and if it’s not, it means you’re having more fun.
                            The most popular version of the Civic sedan, an EX trim level that is equipped with a 1.5-liter turbo-4 and automatic transmission, manages 32 mpg city, 42 highway, 36 combined, according to the EPA.
                            There are quite a few permutations of the Civic’s body style and powertrain, but thankful not much variance when it comes to fuel economy. We’ll hit the highlights below, mostly because numbers are boring.
                            Coupes are rated within earshot of similarly powered sedans, although each loses 1 or 2 mpg in city and highway rating. An EX 1.5-liter turbo-4 is rated at 30/41/35 mpg with a manual; 31/40/35 mpg with an automatic.
