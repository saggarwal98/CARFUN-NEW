                        <b><p>The 2018 Jeep Renegade mounts a spirited defense of its brand bona fides, but delivers a less convincing impression of a great economy car.</p></b>With its slab-sided, upright style, the Renegade weaves Jeep heritage into every body panel. The seven-slot grille and round headlights look more Jeep than does anything on the next-class-bigger Cherokee, and the details bring the look home.On the road, the Renegade handles with the usual tall-wagon lean and with steering that’s no better than decent for on-road feel and response. Ride quality suffers with the biggest 18-inch wheels, but for a small car on a short wheelbase, the Renegade does well enough to consider as a daily commuter.

                            Built in Italy, smaller than any modern Jeep before it, the 2018 Renegade does a great job channeling the essential lines and attitude of the brand. It looks more like a real Jeep than the bigger Cherokee right across the showroom.It’s all vertical lines, from the windshield to the tailgate to the seven slots in its grille that carve out its identity–that and the twin round headlights. The wheel wells are squared off in a show of strength, but the Renegade’s shape abounds with tiny Easter eggs—surprising design touches like a mini-Jeep etched into the headlights, a Detroit skyline molded into a dash bin pad, the Xs styled into the taillights in homage to World War II-era fuel cans.

                            Jeep fits a 1.4-liter turbo-4 to base Renegades. It puts out 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet of torque through a 6-speed manual transmission. It’s a decently lively combination when configured with front-wheel drive, but that zesty feel fades when it’s saddled with all-wheel drive, which adds about 150 pounds.Most Renegades will be equipped with a 2.4-liter 4-cylinder with 180 hp and 175 lb-ft of torque. Coupled only to a 9-speed automatic transmission, it yields a vehicle that’s moderately quicker, but one that’s also more noisy to operate, and more ponderous on the road.

                            A small cabin and lots of driveline noise put the Jeep Renegade below average in comfort and quality.The Renegade’s cabin seems wider than it is, a visual trick played by its flat door panels and tall door cutouts. The front seats have acceptable bolstering and shapes, and they’re comfortable for moderately long trips.But the Renegade’s overall length and all-wheel-drive hardware limit interior space. The back seat isn’t comfortable at all for two adults, and three people across in the back seat is a spec-sheet myth.The Renegade’s interior hits a sweet spot between cheap and cheerful, with soft-touch materials that mitigate some of the harder plastics found on the doors.Tire noise is an issue and wind noise increases above 70 mph.

Its headlights are deemed “Poor,” and its child-seat anchors aren’t rated as easy to use.Outward vision is good, thanks to a low beltline and squared-off fenders. To the rear, the thick roof pillars block some of the view, but the side mirrors help matters with their big, rectangular shape.

                            The Jeep Renegade Latitude gets a 7.0-inch touchscreen audio system with satellite radio, Bluetooth with audio streaming, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and 16-inch wheels. The Limited model adds keyless ignition, a 115-volt power outlet, a 180-watt audio system, power front seats, heated front seats, leather, 18-inch wheels, and a split-folding rear seat. An 8.4-inch touchscreen with navigation is an option.Trailhawk Renegades get trimmed out to meet the expectations of off-road users. Its 9-speed automatic gets a simulated low-gear crawl ratio, a rock-driving mode, and a full-size spare tire, along with the mechanical and cosmetic changes listed above.

                            EPA scored the base Renegade turbo-4 with a manual transmission at 24 mpg city, 31 highway, 26 combined.On Renegades equipped with the larger-displacement 2.4-liter inline-4, fuel economy checks in at 21/29/24 mpg with AWD and 22/30/25 mpg with front-wheel drive.
                            Those figures put the Renegade below rivals like the Honda HR-V, which has been rated at up to 31 mpg combined when outfitted with front-wheel drive and a CVT.
