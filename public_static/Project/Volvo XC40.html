        <p style="margin-left:280px;margin-right:260px;">The Volvo XC40 is a new type of Volvo, yet it remains true to the way we’ve always created our cars – designed around you. With design and innovation to make your life more enjoyable and less complicated.</p>

                    <p><b>The 2019 Volvo XC40 upends tradition—and traditional style—in mostly acceptable ways, and kicks off the car-subscription era with a stylish bang.</b></p><br>
                    The 2019 Volvo XC40 compact crossover is unapologetically cast toward shoppers who can’t remember the first season of “The Simpsons.”<br>
                    The XC40 is a substantial departure from Volvo’s other crossovers on the surface—and deeper ways too. The possibilities for looks vary from Amazon Blue with a white roof and white wheels, to bright red with a black roof and black 20-inch wheels.

                            <b><p>Small crossovers are a young buyer’s game, and the 2019 Volvo XC40 looks every bit the part.</p></b>
                            The signature LED headlights—dubbed “Thor’s hammer” by Volvo designers––flank the grill and reach up toward a stamped clamshell hood that relieves the nose from any shunt lines. The roof line is overshadowed by an window line that kinks up from the rear door to create a fat rear roof pillar that meets one of three roof colors with a cutline and trim piece that blends the seams well. On R-Design models, the trim is stamped with an “R-Design” logo that we particularly like. Along the bottom, a contained trapezoidal stamp breaks up the vertical weight of the doors and ties the front to the back well.
                            Inside, the XC40 blends a horizontal dash with a vertical touchscreen toward the middle, where the crossover is its lightest. We admit that the “Lava Orange” carpet won’t be for most buyers, but it’s a refreshing take on what could have been a very dark interior. The door inserts draped in bright colors look strangely odd—and bottom-heavy—but the storage they provide is worth the risk.

                            <b><p>The Volvo XC40 is gifted with a comfortable ride and a very good 8-speed automatic—the rest is icing, and we’ll still take it.</p></b>
                            TXC40 boasts new powertrains with an electric version on the way. The turbo-4 found under the hoods of T5 variants is good; power is delivered quickly without being too sharp, and the 8-speed doesn’t skip ahead too quickly in the name of efficiency.<br>
                            The shifts are smooth and well-timed; comfort mode doesn’t force early upshifts in the name of efficiency, and dynamic driving mode holds them well deep into the rev range for quicker thrusts of the throttle. Volvo’s shifter, however, is maddening to operate. Pulling the car out of park requires two separate pulls of the shift knob, only one tips the car into neutral.
                            It’s easy to pull the shifter down, and jump on the throttle, only to burn gas and not rubber standing still—or worse, rolling backward.

                            <b><p>The 2019 Volvo XC40 makes good use of its small space, and that includes fitting four adults aboard.</p></b>
                            Volvo’s seats are among the best our backsides have sampled, with adequate bolstering and reasonable adjustability (but fall far short of some automakers’ 30-way pivoting thrones). There are several clever storage bins and cubbies, including deep door pockets that can hold notebooks and notebook computers, a trash bin in the center armrest, bag hangers on the glove box, and small slots that can hold parking tickets or credit cards near the driver’s knees.<br>
                            The XC40 offers 20.7 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seats up, and 47.2 cubes with the seatbacks folded down. An optional cargo floor can fold up to offer three more bag hooks and trap small items up against the rear seat back to keep from rolling around the hatch.<br>
                            The system can follow cars in stop-and-go traffic and travel short distances within well-defined lanes without driver input. Volvo calls it a “driver support” system because it will shut off without driver intervention after short distances.

                            Federal and independent safety agencies haven’t yet crash-tested the 2019 Volvo XC40. We’re withholding our scores until they do.<br>
                            Standard on all models are front, side, and curtain airbags for all occupants, including a driver’s knee airbag. Active lane control, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, a rearview camera, and emergency responder notifications are included at every trim level.

                            The XC40 T4 Momentum is base and includes 18-inch wheels, advanced safety features (that we cover above), LED headlights and taillights, leather upholstery, power adjustable driver’s seat, a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, Bluetooth connectivity, and a 9.0-inch touchscreen for infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility.<br>
                            The top T5 AWD R-Design variants add stiffer springs and bigger antiroll bars, a black roof and bigger, 19-inch wheels. That trim level also comes equipped with a power passenger seat, two-zone climate control, navigation, softer leather upholstery with synthetic suede inserts, stiffer springs and bigger antiroll bars, motion-activated tailgate, and black headliner. <br>
                            A $1,400 Premium Package for the Momentum trim level ($900 for R-Design) adds a power adjustable passenger seat, two-zone automatic climate control, wireless phone charging, interior lighting (all standard on R-Design), Pilot Assist semi self-driving features, a foldable cargo floor, and power folding rear back rests.

                            All trim levels of the XC40 use a 2.0-liter turbo-4 and 8-speed automatic to make the most from every drop of gasoline. Volvo has confirmed that a battery electric version of the XC40 is on its way to the U.S., and a plug-in hybrid reportedly is on its way too.
