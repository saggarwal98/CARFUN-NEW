                    <p><b>The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover is the pinnacle of SUVs.</b></p><br>
                    2018 Range Rover is something of a legend in its own time. Even the least expensive base short-wheelbase Range Rover will leave few wanting for more. The lineup climbs fast from there through HSE, Supercharged, Autobiography, and finally SV Autobiography Dynamic with increasing levels of opulence.
                    2018 Range Rover lineup discards most hard buttons and knobs in favor of a pair of touchscreens. The screens are flashy tech not without their flaws, but they make even the most highly outfitted Range Rover feel worth its $200,000 price tag. Additionally, new front and rear seats offer more adjustment and an available massaging function. You’ll have to line up the 2018 with last year’s model to see the exterior differences, but revised LED headlights point the way forward.

                            The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover honors its blocky past but looks forward. It may not be an instant classic like the Range Rovers that preceded it, but the 2018 Range Rover easily earns a 9 out of 10 with two points above average for a sublime, tech-laden interior.<br>
                            Chunky, conservative lines give the Range Rover massive presence. Years ago, the brand discarded its muddy boots looks in favor of streamlined precision, although classic cues like a clamshell-style hood and an airy greenhouse remain.
                            <br>The upper unit functions like a conventional infotainment system, while the lower features configurable screens to operate the climate control and available heated/cooled under most circumstances or a host of other functions like traction control modes at the swipe of a finger.

                            Perhaps no vehicle is as versatile as the 2018 Range Rover. It shines on and off the road, and its broad portfolio of engines range from strong and efficient to astoundingly powerful and thirsty. 
                            <br>Restricted to only the short-wheelbase model is a supercharged gasoline V-6 rated at 340 horsepower and 332 pound-feet of torque. It’s hardly an anchor of a motor, though, and is more than sufficient for nearly any kind of driving. A 3.0-liter turbodiesel V-6 with an impressive 443 lb-ft is optional and a worthwhile upgrade with its strong torque curve and its smooth, docile demeanor. Both 6-cylinder engines pair well to their fast-shifting 8-speed automatic transmissions and they almost make the optional V-8s feel unnecessary. But not quite. The 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 standard on the Supercharged and Autobiography trim levels cranks out a hefty 510 hp and enables these big brutes to sprint to 60 mph from a stop in just over 6 seconds.

                            Front seat passengers have seats that adjust in every direction and offer a new massaging function for 2018. Reshaped rear seats this year deliver power backrest adjustment on every trim level and the option of full adjustment with heating, cooling, and massaging as the price climbs rapidly. Extended-wheelbase variants rectify the only thing close to a complaint we can offer about the standard 2018 Range Rover: its relatively tight legroom. The long-wheelbase variant adds 7.3 inches exactly where it’s needed: in rear-seat stretch-out space. Autobiography variants offer an Executive Seating package with even more comfort with rear seats that recline 40 degrees at the tap of a button, eight-way adjustable headrests, and even a smartphone app that lets passengers adjust seat and climate settings without taking their eyes off of their devices.

                            The 2018 Land Rover Range Rover hasn’t been subjected to federal or independent crash-testing, and it’s not likely that it will be any time soon. This basic design debuted in 2013, but it’s hardly short on safety tech.<br>
                            However, the Range Rover’s stiff structure and its high level of standard safety gear are good news. Extensive aircraft-grade aluminum sections glued and riveted together add strength, while standard full-time four-wheel drive is confidence-inspiring. Left in automatic mode, the Terrain Response system uses various sensors to predict surface grip before the vehicle encounters slippery terrain.

                            The 2018 Range Rover earns points for its high level of standard equipment, its near-infinite customizability, its impressive infotainment system, and its decadent options that include one of the most luxurious back seats available in any form of transportation. <br>
                            Short-wheelbase models are offered in base, HSE, Autobiography, and SVAutobiography trims and run the gamut underhood with available gas or turbodiesel V-6s and V-8s ranging from 518 to 557 horsepower. Long-wheelbase models are positioned even higher on the luxury scale and are available only with V-8s in both Autobiography grades.
                            <br>The HSE adds larger wheels, softer leather, heated rear seats, a panoramic moonroof, and a surround-view camera, while the Supercharged builds in a V-8 engine and a few more goodies. A handful of packages restructured for the 2018 model year for both base and HSE trims pile on goodies like a rear-seat entertainment system, head-up display, and active lane control.

                            <b><p>At up to 24 mpg combined, the Range Rover’s available turbodiesel is a surprisingly low-guilt option.</p></b>
                            It’s just as possible to buy a gas-guzzling 2018 Land Rover Range Rover as it is one that sips diesel.That figure is based on the supercharged V-6 that earns a decent 17 mpg city, 23 highway, 19 combined.
                            The available turbodiesel V-6 isn’t as popular with buyers, and we’re not sure why. Its 22/28/24 mpg isn’t far off of V-6 sedans.
                            Predictably, V-8s use a lot of premium fuel: 16/21/18 mpg at best; the long wheelbase SVAutobiography won't be in an Earth Day parade at 13/19/15 mpg.
