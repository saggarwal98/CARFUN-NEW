                The New 2018 ELITE i20 is aesthetically designed with premium interiors, 
                highly advanced features and spunky looks that make it truly appealing.</p>

            The Elite i20 is a feature loaded hatchback. It comes with projector headlamps with LED DRLs, cornering headlamps, stylish 16-inch alloy wheels, and front air curtains. You can have it even in the dual-tone paint scheme. The seven-inch infotainment system with smartphone connectivity, rear AC vents, USB charger, six airbags and ABS, ISOFIX and reverse parking camera is also part of the package.There have been no mechanical changes on this facelifted i20, but there has been a bit of retuning to both the engine and the chassis. For instance, Hyundai says it has achieved a nine percent increase in fuel economy thanks to a slight remapping of the engine and those aero ducts in the front bumper. In truth, you can feel it a bit when you drive. In this diesel car, for example, the bottom end feels a bit stronger and some of the punch at the top end is missing, thanks to changes to the fuelling.

The seven-inch infotainment system with smartphone connectivity, rear AC vents, USB charger, six airbags and ABS, ISOFIX and reverse parking camera is also part of the package.Hyundai has also tinkered a bit with the suspension and the steering of the i20. They’ve stiffened the rear suspension a little bit and you can feel that in the way the car isn’t quite as bouncy coming off a large speedbreaker, for instance. They’ve also sharpened up the steering a bit and reduced the slack at the centre position to make it feel a bit more engaging than before.The fabric on the seats now has a hounds-tooth pattern, which is a cool, almost retro touch.The touchscreen is one of the best around, with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a simple, clean and easy-to-use interface.

                Hyundai has carried forward the older cars cabin layout. The dull looking cabin only got some new buttons on the steering wheel and that’s about it. <br>And in terms of driving, the Elite i20’s steering feel is still inconsistent off centre and there is more body roll than what you would expect.The long equipment list couldn’t have gotten much longer and the interior quality was already pretty much at the top of the class. Even the changes to the engine mapping are very minor. <br>What is much appreciated is the small but effective attention that’s been paid to dynamics, for whatever it’s worth.This is still no driver’s car, and to truly improve the dynamics would require a full generational leap.
