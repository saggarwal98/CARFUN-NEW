                    Lexus, the Toyota-owned luxury car brand, began its operations in India last year with the RX450h. It’s the carmaker's mid-size luxury SUV that's offered in two trims - Luxury and F-Sport. <br>
                    The RX450h F-Sport sits right in the middle of the three-model-grade RX450h range. All three are AWD and the Luxury starts from $90,160, the F-Sport tested here from $102,460 and the Sports Luxury from $108,610, all before the usual on-road costs. <br>
                    The RX’s second generation kicked off with several worthwhile advancements, including those that make up the Lexus Safety System+. Now standard equipment, the safety suite includes a Pre-Collision System with pedestrian detection, Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist, Intelligent High Beam and High-Speed Dynamic Radar Cruise Control. In addition, Lexus also made Blind Spot Monitoring with Rear Cross Path Detection and automatic braking standard for 2017 RX 450h along with adding Scout GPS Link to the Display Audio in the RX 350 and RX 450h models.

                            The F-Sport gets the brand's signature massive honeycomb spindle grille, but in a subtle mesh pattern. Flanking it are sharp angular LED headlamps featuring distinctive L-shaped DRLs that can shimmer even on the brightest of days. The extra oomph is added by the LED side indicators.These aren't just conventional boring bulbs flashing, but dynamic turn indicators that show the direction of travel.<br>
                            The car’s futuristic looks also extend to its sides with sharp chiselled lines giving it a well-sculpted look. The sloping roof at the back with blackened C-Pillar lends the vehicle a unique shape. The muscular wheel arches host 18-inch seven-spoke alloys that give the SUV that much needed sporty character. It is well-proportioned at the back with a nicely shaped bumper, boot and the wraparound LED tail lamps completing the radical look of the F-Sport.

                            Alhough not of the plug-in variety, this hybrid motor is what puts the ‘h’ in the Lexus RX450h. The SUV comes powered by a 3.5-litre V6 petrol mill, which is helped by two electric motors, one under the hood for charging and one at the back to deliver power to the wheels. This combined hybrid powertrain churns out 308bhp and 335Nm of torque which is sent to all four wheels by a CVT gearbox. It recharges through regenerative braking and recouping energy from the engine.
                            <br> The car feels lazy on the pick-up in Eco mode, but that's mainly to reduce fuel consumption and is therefore ideal for city commuting. However, flick the knob to select Normal mode and the drive gets interesting. The throttle response gets better while still retaining the linear character and yet making things livelier.The F-Sport’s suspension system is interesting – in that it edges toward being firm around town, but still manages to soak up poor surfaces competently without ever banging and crashing. While it can fire up if you get excited, it’s no sports SUV in the vein of a Macan or F-Pace, which makes the ‘Sport’ part of the badge a little redundant.

                            One doesn't have to climb into this SUV and the low-slung dashboard provides good visibility while driving. Like the exterior, the interior design is also busy especially with plenty of buttons and the spread of plastic. Though the quality is good, panel gaps are tight and the use of soft materials gives a good feel.<br>
                            Both seats are powered, cooled/heated, well bolstered and hold you extremely well. The rear seats are supportive too and recline at the press of a button. Rear legroom is more than sufficient, but due to the sloping roofline, headroom can be a little tight for taller occupants. Also, the rear seats fall/rise at the touch of a button accommodating more luggage. Boot space isn't impressive as the full size spare wheel eats up space and is raised due to the electric motor beneath. Nonetheless, there's hands-free access (Lexus badge has a sensor) to the well-shaped loading area which is wide enough to take in big bags.

                            Lexus is also a leader when it comes to safety, with the RX achieving Top Safety Pick + status when its top-line headlight system is included (standard with our RX 450h), while the NHTSA gave it a best-possible five-star safety rating. This said there’s no mention of pedestrian detection, autonomous emergency braking, or lane keeping assist in Canadian-spec literature, so our RX 450h probably doesn’t match up to the U.S. version when it comes to advanced driver assistance systems. There are multiple safety features including ten airbags, cruise control, parking cameras and sensors, multi-terrain ABS and a tyre pressure monitoring system to add to the extensive list of safety features. Still, automatic parking could have been a delightful feature.

                            Despite the presence of a V6 petrol engine, the hybrid system ensures frugal fuel consumption, with Lexus claiming 5.7 litres per 100km on the ADR combined cycle. Overall power is 230kW and 335Nm, so it’s not underpowered by any means either.<br>
                            The price can be a big let-down for buyers as it comes as a CBU model. At Rs 1.52 crores on-road, it is more expensive than the established segment leaders like the Mercedes GLS, BMW X5 and Audi Q7. But then again remember, this price is due to the high import duties and the hybrid powertrain. In terms of fuel efficiency, we couldn't mirror the claimed ARAI numbers of 18.8kmpl. However, with 10.87kmpl in the city and 11.65kmpl on the highway, the RX managed to put up decent real-world numbers for such a heavy car.
