                    The 2018 Audi Q7 is a three-row, large luxury crossover. It’s loaded with features and technology and is easily one of the brand’s most impressive products, and that’s saying something.A 2.0-liter turbo-4 is standard on the Q7 Premium and Premium Plus; a supercharged 3.0-liter V-6 is optional on those models and standard on the Prestige. All models feature an 8-speed automatic transmission that shuttles power to all four wheels via Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system.An air suspension and four-wheel steering are optional on the Prestige trim level, but even the base Q7 rides and handles well. Its steering is light and direct—not enough to give it a genuinely sporty feel, however.

                            The 2018 Audi Q7 hardly deviates from the German brand’s consistent style. Its exterior is clean and well proportioned, if a little unexciting. Inside, however, things are far more dramatic and they’re finished in gorgeous textures.
                            <br>Outside, the Q7 is pleasantly light on overwrought design details. A choice of wheel designs in sizes from 18 to 20 inches fill its big wheel wells nicely. LED headlights are optional on Premium Plus models and standard on the Prestige trim level and they flank a wide, large grille. From the side, the Q7 looks more like a tall wagon than some of its boxier rivals, while the crossover’s tail end is notable mainly for its clamshell-like tailgate. The cargo bay isn’t as wide as the tailgate may lead you to believe.

                            <b><p>A wonderful ride quality, accurate steering, and a turbo 4 make the Q7 a terrific road trip car.</p></b>
                            A 2.0-liter turbo-4 is standard on Q7 Premium and Premium Plus models. It’s rated at 252 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque, enough to move it from a stop to 60 mph in just 7.1 seconds.<br>
                            The power delivery of the turbo-4 in the Q7 isn’t as refined or as smooth as that of the supercharged V-6. Off the line, in most situations, it takes a second for boost to build, then you’re off and into the power.<br>
                            Audi’s Quattro all-wheel-drive system is standard, a boon in wet and slippery conditions. But even with the height-adjustable air suspension that’s optional on the Q7 Prestige, this crossover isn’t meant for much more than a snowy road on the way to a ski resort.The standard suspension fitted to Premium and Premium Plus Q7s almost makes the air suspension not worth the cost and complexity. It’s wonderfully tuned to absorb choppy pavement, but it’s not floaty in corners. The Q7’s steering is light on feel and heft, but the crossover corners well with a planted, confident feel even on a curvy road.

                            As a five-seater, the 2018 Audi Q7 excels. Load up the entire family and it’s not quite as impressive, but even those squeezed into row three are treated to a beautiful interior and a refined feel.<br>
                            The prime seats are up front, of course, where the base leather seats on most Q7s are comfy, supportive, and highly adjustable. The comfort seats available on the Q7 Prestige’s luxury package are, as their name suggests, even more plush—and they boast a massaging feature in addition to their upgraded hides.
                            <br>Regardless of seat, every passenger faces nice plastics, glossy or matte-finish genuine wood trim, and good storage for small items and beverages. The Q7 isn’t cheap, but it feels worth every bit of its asking price.

                            The 2018 Audi Q7 comes well-equipped with safety gear and advanced features that help keep the family safe.All Q7s come with a full complement of airbags and stability control, plus all-wheel drive as standard. Rear side airbags are optional on all models.
                            <br>In terms of collision-avoiding tech, the Q7 comes standard with a low-speed automatic emergency braking system called “Pre Sense City” that can apply the brakes on its own and bring the crossover to a halt if it detects an impending collision at speeds lower than 52 mph. A full-speed system called “Pre Sense Front” is optional on Premium Plus and Prestige models, where it is bundled in the Driver Assistance Package with automatic high-beam headlights, adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, and traffic sign recognition that displays pertinent road information in the instrument cluster.

                            A 7.0-inch infotainment screen comes on the Premium, but navigation and Apple CarPlay require ponying up $3,000 for the MMI Navigation Plus Package. Otherwise, the Q7 Premium’s only major package bundles heated rear seats with a heated steering wheel.
                            <br>Q7s with the MMI Navigation Plus Package are also among the very first cars that can communicate directly with urban infrastructure. In select cities, the Q7 receives data like when a signal will change from red to green from traffic nerve centers. For now, this tech’s usefulness is limited, but vehicle-to-infrastructure communication is a big step on the road to self-driving cars.
                            <br>It’s also available with far more optional equipment, including the Driver Assistance Package with automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control, and the Vision Package that bundles LED headlights with a surround-view camera system and the Digital Cockpit system. Digital Cockpit is Audi-speak for a high-resolution, 12.3-inch LCD screen that replaces analog gauges.

                            The 2018 Audi Q7 offers decent fuel economy given its size and weight, but you won’t save much at the pump by opting for the base turbo-4 engine.
                            <br>The 3.0-liter V-6 scores 19 mpg city, 25 highway, 21 combined.
                            The base 2.0-liter turbo-4 is rated identically to the V-6, which may be a head-scratcher for most folks. Both engines require premium fuel and both feature a start/stop system that cuts out the engine at traffic lights to reduce emissions while idling.
