                    Toyota is deemed to give its owners a reliable and trouble-free ownership experience and that’s the biggest reason why many Indians prefer this brand over many other executive ones. However, when the competition is from well-established and proven brands like Maruti, Hyundai and Honda, it all boils down to the core capabilities of the car. The all-new Yaris has entered a very competitive space and to make it stand out from the crowd, Toyota has given the third-gen model class-leading safety kit like ESP, hill launch assist, traction control, and all-wheel disc brakes. Seven airbags and ABS with EBD is offered on all variants.    The sleek body and the subtlety in design screams Toyota and there's no aggression whatsoever. The wider lower grille could have given the Yaris a bit of an 'in your face' look; but frankly, it looks calm, collected and very sure of itself. The bonnet gets some musculature, but that's about it.

                            Toyota Yaris takes its design inspiration from the Toyota Corolla sedan. It gets a soft and subtle treatment to its front fascia. Toyota Yaris is not the bold or masculine looking car in this segment. Toyota Yaris will remind you of that newcomer in your high school whom you look at and think oh! He/She is cute but that’s it. There is no striking design feature you get away with. The wide lower front grille and some muscle on the bonnet further try to give that aggressive look. The sides of Toyota Yaris gets some nice character line which makes the car look premium and more appealing.The rear hosts fancy designed taillights that make the Toyota Yaris look pretty. The rear bumper is simple with a small plastic cladding below.Toyota Yaris is built on company’s global 'B' platform but returned to give the best performance for the Indian road conditions. The car is 4425 mm in length, 1730 mm in width and stands tall at 1495 mm. It is shorter than the Honda City and does not come across as a large car. The proportion, however, works both aerodynamically and increases the overall cabin space.

                            The 1.5L petrol engine is smooth and very responsive. The power is delivered in a linear fashion. However do not expect quick acceleration on the Toyota Yaris, the engine mated to the CVT is slow to respond quickly. I did not have the option to drive the manual but the CVT is a welcome move in this segment. The gearshifts are quick initially and as you give more gas there are longer revs giving the car more power. Toyota Yaris also gets paddle shifts allowing the driver to take control of the car’s gearshifts.Toyota Yaris feels a bit heavy and firm in initial speeds but that that further affirms high stability and good ride quality. The steering feels a bit heavy in traffic but is sharp and precise. The car takes on rough roads with ease and strong brakes increase the confidence on corners. The short length of the car has helped the Yaris to improve manoeuvrability. An existing Honda City or Hyundai Verna owner might find the Yaris performance average.

                            Toyota Yaris interiors are finished in black and beige colour scheme with ‘waterfall' centre console adding to the overall appeal of the cabin The interiors will remind you of its elder sibling Toyota Corolla. The centre console finished in glossy black is a bit shinier and reflects a lot.The second row seats on the Toyota Yaris is nice and spacious for three-people seating. The rear A/C vents are placed on the roof of the car giving the middle rear passenger more legroom. If your height is over 6 feet the Yaris’ rear seat is not the best place to be in. The use of plastic by Toyota is not the best in the segment and the over fit and finish should have had been a bit better. The best part about the Toyota Yaris interiors is its centre console, finishing around the CVT gear lever and the steering wheel. It is certainly better than Honda City but not that great when compared to the new Hyundai Verna.

                            Toyota Yaris is not the best car in the segment but there is nothing wrong with the car as well. It scores top points in safety with 7 airbags, ABS with EBD, being offered as a standard offering right from the base variant. The top variants of Toyota Yaris also get Hill-assist control, vehicle stability control, reverse camera with sensors and many other safety features.The Yaris comes with first in segment 7 SRS airbags.

                            Toyota Yaris gets a4.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system with in-built navigation. It does not support Apple Car Play and Android Auto but gets the option of MirrorLink. The screen’s response to finger touch is decent, it supports gesture control which is first in this segment and works well but increases driver distraction. The automatic climate control gets soft buttons that enhance the overall cabin. The bulky steering wheel is mounted with controls. Front seats are very comfortable and give good side support.Toyota Yaris misses out on sunroof but gets a cooled glovebox compartment and a manual rear sunblind. There is ample boot space on the Yaris of 476L and can further be expanded by folding the rear seats. In addition to these, the Yaris gets some segment-first features like gesture control for the touchscreen, roof-mounted rear blower with ambient lighting, front parking sensors, 60:40 rear-seat split, a noise and vibration-absorbing glass area and a tyre pressure warning system.

                            Toyota has given the Yaris a taller third and fourth gear, which reflects in its in-gear acceleration timings; it takes 14.74sec and 20.43sec to accelerate from 20-80kph in third and 40-100kph in fourth gear, respectively – significantly slower than the Ciaz (11.32, 16.20sec), Verna (11.71, 15.56sec) and City (12.82, 17.22sec).
                            In our test cycles, the Yaris manual achieved 9.96kpl in the city and 16.4kpl on the highway. The third and fourth gear ratios are slightly tall. The CVT managed 9.11kpl in the city and 16kpl on the highway, which is quite a respectable figure; but it’s nowhere close to the claimed 17.8kpl figure.
