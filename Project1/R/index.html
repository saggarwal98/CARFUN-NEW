Now, the All-New BMW M5 returns to reclaim its title – and set new standards, on track day and every day.</p>

                    <p><b>The 2018 BMW M5 is equal parts performance monster and luxury cruiser.</b></p><br>
                    The 2018 BMW M5 sedan makes up for some of the sins of the previous generation while it commits a few of its own. The new F90-generation M5 turns up the fun factor versus the outgoing F10 and provides more feedback, but it’s still heavy and it no longer offers a manual transmission. It adds all-wheel drive for the first time, but it’s rear-biased and BMW lets drivers turn it off.<br>
                    BMW added much of that weight back in with anew M xDrive all-wheel-drive system that has three settings: 4WD, 4WD Sport, and 2WD. The system has a rear bias and 4WD Sport sends more power to the rear, while 2WD shuts off both the all-wheel drive and the stability control to turn the M5 into a drift monster for those who hate rear tires.

                            <b><p>The 2018 BMW M5 balances a handsome exterior with sporty and elegant interior.</p></b>
                            The M5 doesn’t take a huge leap from the last-generation model, and it borrows liberally from the larger 7-Series, though it features many of its own details—more than any other 5-Series. We like the exterior design. It takes the basic good looks of the 5-Series and adds a sinister element.<br>
                            Up front, BMW’s twin-kidney grilles are pronounced and outlined in chrome. Large air intakes sit menacingly at the front corners, with another larger intake between them that feeds the oil cooler.<br>
                            For weight savings, BMW stamps the front fenders and hood in aluminum. The hood features two central and two outer creases that the base models lack, while the fenders have signature M gills up high instead of the 7-Series-inspired chrome trim pieces mounted low. Side skirts help ground the car in the profile view, and the roof is carbon fiber for the first time.

                            <b><p>The multi-talented 2018 BMW M5 is lightning quick and track-ready when performance calls, but comfortable when it’s time to cruise.</p></b>
                            The 2018 BMW M5 has something for everyone. It boasts 600 horsepower under the hood and that makes it fast in a straight line, but it’s meant for track duty. Its all-wheel-drive system helps it handle the curves, and it can be turned off to let the M5 drift through corners. Turn the mode selector to Comfort and go easy on the throttle and the M5 becomes a comfortable luxury sedan. <br>
                            The M5 has some advanced features, but it lacks some others. It relies instead on a balanced chassis to deliver an engaging and neutral handling character. Under the hood it features an upgraded twin-turbocharged 4.4-liter V-8 that now makes 600 hp from 5,700 to 6,600 rpm and 553 lb-ft of torque from 1,800 to 5,700 rpm. Those figures represent significant jumps from the previous generation’s 560 hp and 500 lb-ft of torque.<br>
                            The lone transmission is an 8-speed automatic that replaces both a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic and a 6-speed manual.

                            The 2018 BMW M5 builds upon the standard 5-Series with sport seats, sporty trim, and additional gauge readouts to fulfill its performance mission.The M5 comes standard with an extended leather upholstery and a dashboard covered in synthetic leather. BMW offers a full-leather package to gussy it up even more. All of the surfaces are either soft to the touch or made of a high-quality material. An aluminum carbon blend serves as the standard interior trim, though BMW also offers two types of wood and piano black. More quality materials set the stage for an exemplary cabin, including a dark Alcantara headliner, seat controls with rubber grips, and ceramic control knobs.<br>
                            Front occupants sit on 20-way M sport seats that even adjust to accommodate the thighs and shoulders. A heated steering wheel and heated front seats come standard, and buyers can opt for rear seat heating and front seat cooling with massagers.

                            The 2018 BMW M5 comes standard with front and rear parking sensors, a rearview camera, blind-spot monitors, lane-departure warnings, forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking, and six airbags.A Driving Assistance Plus package adds active lane control, adaptive cruise control with stop and go, and front and rear cross-traffic alerts. Also offered is night vision with pedestrian detection.<br>
                            While the M5 hasn’t been crash tested, the IIHS has tested the 2018 BMW 5-Series, which has the same basic vehicle structure. That car earned the agency’s highest award, Top Safety Pick+, as it scored the highest score of “good” in every crash test, earned the best score of “good” for its headlights, and earned the top score of “Superior” for its front crash prevention system.

                            Both a performance car and a luxury car, the BMW comes fully equipped with the features for both, though for a six-figure price. In addition to the standard equipment, BMW offers plenty of options to increase both the luxury and the performance.<br>
                            The main difference between the M5 and other 5-Series models is the performance equipment. Those features include the adaptive M-tuned suspension, M compound ventilated brakes (15.5-inch front rotors with 6-piston calipers, 15-inch rear rotors), the Active M differential, a carbon-fiber rear spoiler, and 275/40 front and 285/40 rear Michelin Pilot Sport 4 summer performance tires mounted on lightweight 19-inch wheels.

                            <b><p>Who worries about fuel economy with 600 horsepower under the hood?</p></b>
                            Want efficiency? Look to BMW’s i cars, not the M models. Still, with 600 horsepower on tap, the 2018 BMW M5 isn’t as hard on fuel as it could be.<br>
                            The M5 comes with just one engine/transmission configuration, and the EPA rates it at 15 mpg city, 21 highway, and 17 mpg combined. That’s poor enough to subject it to a $1,000 gas-guzzler tax.<br>
                            Go easy on the throttle and it won’t cost you too much, but engage those turbos and you’ll be filling the tank with high-test often.
