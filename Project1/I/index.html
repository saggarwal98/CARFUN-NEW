                        <b>The 2018 Audi Q3 offers a fun-to-drive alternative to the entry compact luxury car, but with more utility. Versus its rivals, it delivers more ride comfort and interior refinement, but less fuel efficiency.</b><br>
                        <br>The Q3 conforms to Audi’s crossover styling cues, but in a smaller package. The look is somewhat stubby, but attractive and it should age well. Inside, it’s not as high-end as other Audis, but the black expanse of the dash is broken up by bits of metal trim and an infotainment screen.<br>
                        The small crossover SUV is simultaneously a tall-riding hatchback, the most affordable Audi crossover, a luxury car, and a urban runabout.<br>
                        The Q3 adheres to a simple model strategy, offering one powertrain, front- or all-wheel drive, and three models: Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige.

                            <b><p>The Audi Q3 plays out its familiar crossover shape over a smaller canvas, creating a stubbier, but still attractive look.</p></b>
                            As a small crossover at the bottom of the lineup, the 2018 Audi Q3 straddles a middle ground between the A3 Sportback (hatchback) and its larger Q5 brother. It doesn’t forge a new path for Audi design: it adopts familiar cues to a smaller canvas.<br>
                            Up front, the Q3’s grille sits low, flanked by narrow headlights that balance out intakes that look fairly large for this vehicle. This year even the base model gets the meaner-looking S line front bumper and door sills. The flanks are sculpted gently, and the glass is slimmer than that of the Q5. The tailgate wraps around the rear end, and the LED taillights provide an attractive rear signature.Interior space is limited. The front seat is the best place to be, though the standard panoramic sunroof robs headroom for taller occupants. The rear seat offers limited headroom and knee room for anyone over 6 feet tall. The cargo area is fairly useful, especially with the rear seats folded down.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Q3 is nimble and its powertrain is responsive around town, but it’s not particularly quick.</p></b>
                            The 2018 Audi Q3 keeps performance simple. Only one engine and transmission are offered, and Audi has just a single suspension setup. The only choice is between front- and all-wheel drive.<br>
                            The powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter turbo-4 that puts out 200 horsepower and 207 pound-feet of torque mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission. This engine is exceptionally well-tuned and responsive, and the transmission has well-spaced gears and delivers confident shifts.<br>
                            Q3 is heavier than it looks and the 0-60 mph run takes a pedestrian 7.8 seconds with front-wheel drive or 8.2 seconds with all-wheel drive.

                            <b><p>The 2018 Audi Q3 offers supportive optional sport seats and a modicum of interior utility for such a small crossover.</p></b>
                            Q3 has more shoulder room than some rivals, and the center console doesn’t rob too much knee room. Still, the best place to be in the Q3 is the driver’s seat, and, short of that, the front passenger seat. The driving position is natural and the seats are comfortable. The available sport seats are a must-have due to their extra support. Unfortunately, anyone over 6 feet tall will find that the standard panoramic sunroof cuts into head room.<br>
                            In terms of interior quality, the Q3 sits at the bottom of the Audi lineup. That’s not as bad as it sounds, Audi makes great interiors. Still, the look is a bit stark, and the materials are generally good, but not as rich as you get in just about any other model.The rear seat borders on snug for adult passengers. Here, 6-footers will find their knees up against the front seats and their heads touching the headliner.

                            The 2018 Audi Q3 comes with some a modest list of safety features and it lacks some important ones.Standard safety equipment includes a rearview camera, the usual roster of airbags, and front and rear parking sensors. Buyers can also get blind-spot monitors, but forward-collision warnings with automatic emergency braking are not available.<br>
                            The Q3 earned top "Good" scores in all crash tests from the IIHS. However, it received a “Poor” rating for its headlights and its lack of a forward-collision warning system means it can’t be named a Top Safety Pick or Top Safety Pick+. The NHTSA hasn't yet crash-tested the Q3.<br>
                            Visibility to the rear is somewhat obstructed by thick pillars and small glass area, but otherwise the Q3 is fairly easy to see out of, and the standard rearview camera is appreciated.

                            Audi offers the Q3 with front- or all-wheel drive and in Premium, Premium Plus, and Prestige trim levels. It comes with good base and optional equipment, and the infotainment system is good too.All models now come standard with the S line exterior trim, which includes different front bumper and door sills, plus S line badging. Standard equipment on the Premium model includes 12-way power-adjustable front seats (heated for 2018), keyless ignition, a rearview camera, a 10-speaker AM/FM/CD audio system, satellite radio, a USB port, Bluetooth connectivity, a panoramic sunroof, LED taillights and daytime running lights, and 18-inch alloy wheels. A new Convenience package for the Premium comes with a power liftgate and an auto-dimming rearview mirror with a compass.

                            The 2018 Audi Q3 is a small crossover, but its fuel economy isn’t as thrifty as its size might indicate.<br>
                            Q3 isn’t long or sleek enough to realize any highway fuel economy benefits from its design, which is evidenced by its rating of less than 30 mpg on the highway. In fact, its EPA fuel economy ratings with both front- and all-wheel drive are 20 mpg city, 28 highway, 23 combined.
                            <br>Audi has announced no hybrid plans for the Q3 and any diesel likely has been scuttled by the “Dieselgate” scandal.The larger Q5 uses a more powerful powertrain and gets better fuel economy, and competitors from BMW and Mercedes-Benz also beat the Q3 in fuel economy.
